The Technology and Policy Program does not require students to submit their work in this format. However, I published my work as a jupyter-book for the following reasons:

1. This was a helpful tool for showcasing my writing skills, data analysis skills, and Python skills.

2. Before embarking on my thesis journey, I would have liked to see a thesis's complete content (code + text), so I hope that future TPP students will also find this resource helpful.

# Assessing the role of top-down techniques for improving regional estimates of artisanal and small-scale gold mining mercury emissions
## Abstract
ASGM is the world's largest source of anthropogenic Hg emissions and is common in Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and East Asia. However, the amount of mercury emitted from ASGM and contributing to global mercury emissions is subject to substantial uncertainty. Bottom-up studies have quantified sources of Hg, including ASGM, using data on underlying activities to estimate regional and global totals. In contrast, top-down studies have used atmospheric concentration measurements and models to constrain Hg emissions. However, no top-down estimates have yet been calculated for ASGM emissions. With GEOS-Chem's global-scale chemical transport model for Hg, we investigate whether and how ASGM-related Hg emissions can be quantified from existing regional measurement sites for gaseous elemental mercury (GEM). By combining our top-down method with existing bottom-up data, we improve estimates of Hg emissions from ASGM activities, using Peru and the Madre de Dios region of South America as case studies. We find that quantitative constraints on ASGM emissions are better provided by information on the shape of the probability distribution of GEM concentrations, such as the interquartile range and the 95\% range, suggesting possible design guidelines for monitoring networks. The model-based analysis offers insights into improving regional estimates of ASGM emissions. 


## Acknowledgments

I am filled with sincere gratitude as I think about my time at MIT, the journey to get here and all the people that have helped me along the way. Most importantly, I would like to thank Noelle Selin, my research advisor, for welcoming me into her research group. 

This thesis would not have been possible without the Selin Group's training, challenging questions, and comradery. I am especially grateful to Aryeh Feinberg for his unyielding patience, for helping me with GEOS-Chem, and for encouragement. Thank you to all of the Selin Group's members. I have learned much from you.

I would like to thank Barb DeLaBarre, Elena Byrne, Ed Ballo, and Frank Field for everything they do for us. I am grateful to the TPPers in the classes ahead of us who provided invaluable advice on how to navigate MIT since we began our time remotely. Thanks to my TPP cohort (class of 22), we were able to learn, grow, and explore MIT in a supportive environment that we all created and sustained. 

I am also grateful to everyone who has contributed to my academic journey. From my primary school teachers in Manzini, Eswatini to all the professors I have had here at MIT, I am grateful. Thank you to my mentors who have provided guidance and support. 

To Moreen: Thank you for your love that has kept me sane and helped me grow. You have been my strength through this journey's ups and downs. I love you. 

And finally, thank you to my family in Eswatini. I would not be where I am today without your love and support. I love you.
