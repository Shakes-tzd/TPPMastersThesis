<p>To measure the effectiveness of mitigation and elimination strategies
for reducing Hg pollution from ASGM, Hg emissions estimates will be
compared to baseline estimates per Article 22 of the MC. The ASGM
industry is often unregulated, with little government oversight and a
limited amount of reliable data[&#64;oneill_estimating_2017]. Therefore,
measurement of Hg use in the ASGM sector is difficult due to its
complexity and largely informal nature. Typically, finding reasonable
estimates of ASGM Hg use, gold production, and staff requires extensive
site visits, multiple interviews, observations, and measurements at ASGM
sites[&#64;oneill_estimating_2017].</p>
<p>In this chapter, we apply a top-down approach at a regional scale to
estimate ASGM Hg emissions (emission inversion) from Peru. As of now,
there has been no scientific study using Hg atmospheric monitoring data
and atmospheric models to provide top-down constraints for ASGM
emissions. Section <a class="reference external" href="#c3_methods">1.2</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”c3_methods”} describes the overall methodology. We combine
ground-based observations of atmospheric Hg from the case study
region[&#64;koenig_seasonal_2021], a national inventory for
Peru[&#64;artisanal_gold_council_reporte_2017] and simulations with the
GEOS-Chem global CTM. Reference (also known as a priori) emissions are
from the GMA

<h2><span class="section-number">3.1. </span>Background<a class="headerlink" href="#background" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Numerous prior studies have quantified anthropogenic Hg sources,
including ASGM Hg emissions using different methodologies. Bottom-up
estimates leverage collected data on underlying activities and emission
factors to estimate regional and global totals. For instance, the
bottom-up global inventory in the GMA 2018 estimated ASGM Hg emissions
to be 838 Mg with an uncertainty range of 675-1000 Mg for 2015
[&#64;united_nations_environment_programme_technical_2019; &#64;steenhuisen_development_2019].
Moreover, Streets et al. (2019) tested six different proxies for scaling
emissions to other years and used an average value to scale the
inventory of emissions to the year 2015, thus estimating that ASGM was
the largest source and responsible for 775 Mg of
emissions[&#64;streets_global_2019]. Muntean et al. (2014) also used a
bottom-up technique in which they found that poverty in gold ore-rich
countries (as measured by the GINI index [&#64;sadefo_kamdem_nice_2012],
where available) was correlated with data on ASGM production activity.
The poverty-based approach they used estimated that ASGM was responsible
for 728.27 Mg emissions in 2010, equivalent to 41.1% of the global Hg
emissions[&#64;muntean_evaluating_2018]. Such inventories are essential and
a critical input to model Hg using CTMs such as .</p>
<p>However, the different assumptions on the activity data and emission
factors induce significant uncertainty in the emission inventories.
Furthermore, the bottom-up approach has biases due to its reliance on
officially reported emission data, which may cause regional and national
differences in accuracy. Countries identify and quantify Hg sources
released within their borders through national baseline Hg-use estimates
as per O’neill and Telmer[&#64;oneill_estimating_2017]. Under Article 7 of
the MC and Annex C, countries must include in their NAPs baseline
estimates of the quantities of mercury used in ASGM within their
territory[&#64;united_nations_environment_programme_estimating_2017].</p>
<p>In contrast to bottom-up approaches, top-down emission estimation
approaches combine atmospheric transport and chemistry models with
atmospheric concentration measurements to quantify emissions. Even
though the atmospheric chemistry literature has various top-down method
applications, no study explicitly constrains ASGM Hg emissions. For
instance, Bousquet et al., 1999 applied top-down methods to infer
surface fluxes of atmospheric CO~2~ from observed
concentrations[&#64;bousquet_inverse_1999]. Furthermore, Kopacz et al.,
2009, employed top-down techniques to quantify source contributions to
ozone pollution at two adjacent sites on the U.S. west coast in the
spring of 2006[&#64;kopacz_global_2010]. They used as a common
intercomparison platform to show global consistency between the
satellite data sets and the in situ data. This underscores the role
models such as GEOS-chem have as integration platforms for differently
sourced data to generate unified insights. Likewise, Hg emissions have
been constrained using top-down methods in Song et al., 2015 where a
top-down approach at a global scale is applied to quantitatively
estimate present-day Hg emission sources and critical parameters in
GEOS-Chem to better constrain the global biogeochemical cycle of
Hg[&#64;song_top-down_2015]. Moreover, Denzler et al., 2017 used a top-down
approach to quantify Hg emissions on a European scale based on the
atmospheric Hg measurements conducted at the remote high-altitude
monitoring station, Jungfraujoch, Switzerland[&#64;denzler_inversion_2017].</p>

<p>Chapter 2 of this thesis discussed the differences between the model
predictions of Hg at various monitoring stations and in Latin America.
In one hypothesis, the difference between the model and the observations
was attributed to how the emissions were parameterized in . Generally,
the input emissions in are determined by the Hg inventory used; hence,
we first evaluated the Hg inventory used in the simulations in Chapter 2
(GMA 2018, also called AMAP/UNEP 2015 inventory) against other global
inventories. Next, the inventory was compared to a national inventory
for Peru developed by the Artisanal Gold Council in preparation for
Peru’s NAP [&#64;agc_reporte_2017]. Once the differences between the GMA
2018 inventory[&#64;steenhuisen_development_2019] and the Peruvian national
inventory were analyzed [&#64;agc_reporte_2017], the global inventory was
re-gridded to the GEOS-Chem grid, and the emissions from grid boxes
corresponding to different departments in Peru were scaled. The scaled
inventories were used to create the simulations described in Table
<a class="reference external" href="#tab:all_geos_chem_simulations">1.1</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”tab:all_geos_chem_simulations”}. These simulations were used
to investigate the sensitivity of the Hg concentration at distant
locations to the changes in emissions from the grid boxes in the case
study region. The simulated in the atmosphere was compared to the
observed TGM concentration in the atmosphere to determine the
sensitivity of the to the changes in emissions from individual grid
boxes and multiple grid boxes.</p>

<a class="reference external" href="#fig:Hg_inventories">1.1</a>{reference-type=”ref”

2018 inventory were distributed by assigning emission estimates to
geo-located point sources, using reported emissions information where
available, and otherwise assigning a modeled emission to the point.
Emissions that could not be assigned to point sources were distributed
using sector-specific proxies [&#64;steenhuisen_development_2019]. The
proxies for ASGM Hg emissions in Peru were the locations of legal mining
concessions and the global alluvial gold map <span class="xref myst">data

This inventory estimated that ASGM was responsible for about 110 tonnes
of annual emissions in Peru. Moreover, the GMA 2018 inventory was used
in all the GEOS-Chem simulations conducted in this study. This inventory
was used because it was more representative of the ASGM emissions than
the other two inventories, as the total Hg emissions are compatible with
bottom-up baseline ASGM Hg emissions. Figure

were distributed in the EDGAR ASGM Hg emissions

inventory includes emissions from all key mercury emitting sources, and
Peru’s total Hg emissions estimate was about 26 tonnes per year.
Finally, Figure <a class="reference external" href="#fig:Hg_inventories">1.1</a>{reference-type=”ref”

<p>TGM and GEM observation data from different locations in Latin America
were analyzed and compared to the simulated concentrations for those
sites in Chapter 2. The predictions for ASGM contributions to
atmospheric Hg concentration were higher at the CHC, making it an
excellent candidate to use as a reference for comparison with the
modified Hg concentration predictions. Moreover, this site is the
closest monitoring site to Peru hence it is expected that it would be
more likely to detect atmospheric changes that result from the changes
in Hg emissions from the case study region. The time series of the
observed concentration at the CHC station between July 2014 and January
2016 is shown in Figure <a class="reference external" href="#fig:chc_time_series">1.2</a>{reference-type=”ref”

<p>Inverse modeling is described by Brasseur, and Jacob
[&#64;brasseur_modeling_2017] as a method for quantifying variables that
drive a physical system using observations. Accordingly, the variables
are statistically optimized based on the observational and other
information available. Variables we wish to optimize are called state
variables and assembled into a state vector <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>. In the same way, the
observations are assembled into an observation vector <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y\)</span>. The forward
model <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F\)</span> of the physical system describes the relationship between <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span>
and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ \begin{align}\begin{aligned}\label{inverse_model}
y=F(x,p) + \epsilon_0$$ where:\\\$p$\\:   contains all variables in the model that we will not optimize as
    part of the inversion\\$\epsilon_0$\\:   a vector of observations errors, which includes errors from
    measurements, the forward model, and model parameters\\Forward models describe the effects of the system as functions of the
cause $x$, usually by using equations that describe the system's
physics. The cause ($x$) can be quantified via inversion of the model
based on the effect ($y$). Moreover, $x$ is estimated with some
statistical error when $\epsilon_0 \neq 0$ is present. The solution for
$x$ is called the optimal estimate, posterior estimate
[&#64;brasseur_modeling_2017].\\The uncertainty in obtaining $x$ from $y$ requires us to consider
constraints on the value of $x$ called priors that could reduce the
error on the optimal estimate. We generally use the prior estimate $x_A$
as a constraint, representing our best estimate of $x$ before the
observations. The GMA 2018 inventory estimates of the emissions from the
respective grid boxes are used as priors for our analysis. The prior
estimate $x_A$ has some error $\epsilon_A$. As a result, the ideal
estimate must consider the relative information given by the
observations $y$ and the prior estimate $x_A$. In inverse modeling, we
can analyze the relative importance of observations and prior knowledge.
In this way, it provides insight into the effectiveness of an observing
system in constraining $x$ (Hg emissions) [&#64;brasseur_modeling_2017].\\For this analysis, we use the measured Hg concentration (observation
vector $y$) to constrain the emissions from grid boxes in the case study
region (state vector $x$). The forward model is given by the linear
combination of the signals generated by the GEOS-Chem model as shown in

<p>The Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a valuable sampling method for
fitting models to data[&#64;hogg_data_2018]. We apply the MCMC to constrain
ASGM Hg emissions from the case study region in Peru. The model is
generated by a set of parameters and emissions, and we aim to sample
from the parameters that best fit our data. The MCMC compares the
modeled concentrations to the observed data using metrics such as the
confidence interval, mean, and the . The MCMC models the given data by
sampling around optimum values from the posterior distribution. The MCMC
is a Bayesian approach; hence it requires the definition of priors on
the parameters of interest. The priors encode information that we
already know of the system. The probability of the model given the
observed data is given by the posterior probability, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(\theta|D)\)</span>,
which is calculated using the Bayes theorem:</p>
<p>$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\label{bayes_eq}
P(\theta|D)=\frac{P(D|\theta)P(\theta)}{P(D)}\)</span>$ where:</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(D|\theta)\)</span></p>
<p>:   is the likelihood which is the probability of the data given the
model</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(\theta)\)</span></p>
<p>:   is the prior, which is the probability of the model and</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(D)\)</span></p>
<p>:   is the evidence which is the probability of the data.</p>
<p>Bayes’ theorem relates posterior the probability distributions of
parameters (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f_{post}(\theta, D)\)</span>) to the likelihood function
(<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f(D | \theta)\)</span>) and prior knowledge of the parameter distributions
(<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f_{prior}(\theta)\)</span>)</p>
<p>The MCMC with the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm enables the estimation
of the sampling of the posterior distribution, which is the left-hand
side of Equation <a class="reference external" href="#bayes_eq">[bayes_eq]</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”bayes_eq”} by directly computing <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(\theta)\)</span> and
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(D|\theta)\)</span>, and their product, for a very large ensemble of values of
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span> sampling strategically the n-dimensional space defined by the
dimension of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span>[&#64;brasseur_modeling_2017]. When applying MCMC
sampling, a new parameter set <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\theta^{k+1})\)</span> is drawn from normal
distributions with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\theta^{k})\)</span>, as the mean. Using the new parameter
set, the posterior probability is calculated and compared to the
previous set <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((r = \frac{f^{k+1}}{f^k})\)</span>. With probability <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span> greater
than 1, the sample set is accepted, while with probability <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r\)</span> less than
1, the sample set is rejected. Should the new parameter set be rejected,
the previous parameter set <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((\theta^{k+1}= \theta^k)\)</span> will be retained.
We repeat this process for 1000 samples. Using these samples, we compute
summary statistics on parameter posterior distributions.</p>

the Peru ASGM Hg emissions estimates from the AGC’s
inventory[&#64;agc_reporte_2017] would be mapped on to the GEOS Chem Grid.
The estimates for the total ASGM emissions from Peru are almost similar
in both inventories, 110.4 t/y in the GMA 2018 and 108.74 t/y in the AGC
national inventory.</p>

<p>The AGC’s Peru national inventory attributed most of the ASGM Hg
emissions to the South Eastern departments in the
country[&#64;agc_reporte_2017]. As seen in Table
<a class="reference external" href="#tab:agc_vs_gma18">1.2</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”tab:agc_vs_gma18”}, the Madre de Dios department is the
largest source of Hg emissions, followed by Arequipa, Puno, Ayacucho,
Cusco, respectively. The rest of Peru together contributes about 0.98
tonnes of Hg emissions annually. In contrast with the AGC’s method,
Steenhuisen, and Wilson[&#64;steenhuisen_development_2019] based the Hg
emissions spatial distribution on a proxy based on the likelihood of
gold occurrence in soils, sediments, and bedrock and knowledge of actual
ASGM activity. For Peru, they used the global alluvial gold map and a
(gold) mining concessions dataset for Peru.</p>
<p>The Madre de Dios department is a well-known ASGM hotbed in Peru, and
within the Amazon region hence the GMA 2018 estimate of Hg emissions of
1.39 t/y can be easily identified as inaccurate. Moreover, Diringer et
al.[&#64;ding_w_dynamic_2020] estimated that the amount of Hg used in ASGM
in Madre de Dios was at least 30 tons per year, which also undermines
the GMA 2018 estimate.</p>
<p>As discussed in Chapter 2, the model did not reproduce atmospheric Hg
concentrations, and the above comparison of global and national
inventories was conducted to determine the role played by emission
inputs in the poor model’s replication of observed atmospheric
concentrations. In light of the uncertainty in the inventories of Hg
emission estimates and the above findings about the differences in the
inventories, it was hypothesized that the poor predictions of may be the
result of incorrect emission parameterization in . Following are the
results of scaling the emissions from the departments in the case study
and comparing them with observations. A top-down estimate of Hg
emissions for Peru is also provided.</p>

0.0207. This is in line with the general result in Chapter 2 that the
model poorly estimates the observed Hg emission concentrations in the
atmosphere. Brasseur and Jacob (p.471)[&#64;brasseur_modeling_2017] argue
that in cases where a model captures the observed means but not the
observed variability, the mean may be wrongly interpreted
[&#64;brasseur_modeling_2017]. In line with Brasseur and Jacob’s argument,
the wrong interpretation of the mean is encapsulated in the direct
comparison of the and . This is because Hg concentrations in the
atmosphere captured in are affected by ASGM emissions near CHC.
Moreover, a poor definition of dry deposition or vegetation uptake in
the model further leads to underestimating observed Hg concentrations.</p>

<p>These are the first ever top-down estimates of Hg emissions from ASGM
activities. Even though the ranges of the estimates are wide, they
result from the uncertainty in the models and data we could access.
Therefore, these results may be improved if more data from monitoring
sites were available to constrain the emissions. Nevertheless, the
top-down estimate of the total amount of ASGM Hg emissions
under-predicts the GMA 2018 total estimate for Peru by a factor of 1.09
and the AGC estimate by a factor of 1.08. The comparison of the top-down
ASGM Hg estimates with the bottom-up estimates is visualized in Figure
<a class="reference external" href="#fig:all_asgm_hgEstimates">1.6</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”fig:all_asgm_hgEstimates”}. It is essential to highlight the
Madre de Dios region’s estimate of 21 tons/year of ASGM Hg emissions.
This estimate is an improvement aligned with the literature about the
high ASGM Hg emissions in the region. However, it is still a drastic
underestimate compared to the AGC baseline ASGM Hg estimate for Madre de
Dios.</p>
<p><img alt="Bar chart shows the different estimates of the total ASGM Hg emissionsfrom Peru. The height of the bars indicates the estimated Totalemissions, and the error in each estimate is shown by the errorbars." src="book/templates/figures/all_asgm_hgEstimates.pdf" />{#fig:all_asgm_hgEstimates

<p>Our study produced top-down estimates of ASGM Hg emissions for four
Peruvian departments and thus the country’s total ASGM Hg emissions
estimates. Table <a class="reference external" href="#tab:MCMC_estimates">1.4</a>{reference-type=”ref”
reference=”tab:MCMC_estimates”} shows Peru emits 101.23 tons of Hg
annually, ranging from 11.45 tons to 236.69 tons. There is a wide range
here, but it is a confidence interval based on the data and the
uncertainty of the model discussed so far. The estimates would be
improved if more relevant measurements of atmospheric Hg were used
instead of just one-site data. Another potential source of refinement in
the estimates may result from the model’s improved parameterization of
vegetation uptake discussed in Feinberg et al
[&#64;feinberg_evaluating_2022].</p>
<p>Model improvements and more time series atmospheric Hg concentration
data may enable us to use the mean as another constraint for producing
emission estimates. Also, these results demonstrate that extreme values
are vital for quantifying non-point sources like ASGM, where variability
over time is somewhat unpredictable. The analysis in this chapter
focused on a region in Peru where ASGM dominates. These top-down will be
challenging to implement in areas where ASGM co-occurs with many point
sources, such as Southeast Asia, where biomass and coal are burned
simultaneously. Furthermore, the global resolution of GEOS-Chem is not
particularly suitable for monitoring Hg in mountainous regions such as
CHC. Future work may extend this method and this proof of concept using
more satisfactory results focusing on the region.</p>
<p>In addition to helping resolve the differences in global and national
ASGM Hg emission estimates, the above analysis also provides a stronger
foundation for answering the second question about how regional
monitoring networks can improve the utility of models for MC
effectiveness evaluations. Creating these inverse models for PAS data
would be challenging since it is a discrete dataset that only shows
averages for a specific period. However, active sampling data is
continuous and can be analyzed through summary statistics such as mean,
, correlation, and . Even though the mean of the concentrations was not
viable for this analysis, the other metrics were instrumental in
generating the results.</p>

<p>The study showed that time series monitoring data and the GEOS-Chem CTM
could be used together to produce top-down estimates of Hg emissions
from ASGM activities. In spite of limited data sources and uncertain
models, our ASGM Hg emission estimates were within ranges estimated by
GMA 2018
[&#64;united_nations_environment_programme_technical_2019; &#64;steenhuisen_development_2019]
and AGC [&#64;agc_reporte_2017]. The objective of this study was to prove
the concept of top-down techniques for estimating Hg emissions from ASGM
activities. In addition to improvements in the model, more time series
data would help reduce the uncertainty in this approach and potentially
make mean concentrations more useful. We applied the top-down techniques
to a country in Latin America, where ASGM is the dominant source of
pollution. For future research and interest in applying it elsewhere, it
is essential to note that extending this approach to areas where ASGM Hg
emissions occur alongside other sources may prove challenging.</p>
