<p>Quantitative estimates of Hg emitted into the atmosphere by each country
and the corresponding impacts on human health and the environment are
crucial for effectively assessing whether legally-binding agreements
such as the Minamata Convention (MC) are effective. In such a context,
it is evident that quantifying current and future emissions with the
best degree of accuracy is an indispensable prerequisite. Consequently,
developing and using appropriate methodologies and tools for calculating
current emissions and projections within a reasonable uncertainty range
is crucial. This chapter aims to provide recommendations on using
atmospheric models and monitoring to policymakers in regions with high
ASGM incidence to understand ASGM Hg emissions to the atmosphere and its
evolution over time.</p>
<p>Section <a class="reference external" href="#recap">1.1</a> gives a quick summary of the first three chapters.
Section <a class="reference external" href="#nap_gma18_differences">1.2</a> discusses the discrepancies
between GMA 2018 ASGM Hg emission estimates and those in the NAPs. This
section aims to underscore the value add that atmospheric monitoring and
modeling provide in the presence of such inconsistencies. Moreover,
section <a class="reference external" href="#motreal_protocol_comparison">1.3</a> uses the Montreal Protocol
as an example to discuss the possibilities provided by combining
atmospheric monitoring and modeling to inform actions by parties as well
as evaluate the effectiveness of the MC. The discussion in this section
drives the point that atmospheric monitoring and modeling provides
valuable information but may be politically controversial depending on
the expectation of parties and the type of penalties imposed on
violators of MC’s legally binding agreements. Next, section
<a class="reference external" href="#c4_recommendations">1.4</a> discusses recommendations for governments and
policymakers by emphasizing that governments need to prioritize
atmospheric monitoring and modeling to understand and combat ASGM Hg
emission sources.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">2.1. </span>Review of First Three Chapters<a class="headerlink" href="#review-of-first-three-chapters" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>This chapter builds upon the results of the first three chapters of this
thesis. Chapter one discussed the nature of ASGM activities and their
estimated contribution to the global Hg budget. Moreover, challenges
regarding knowledge of ASGM Hg emissions were discussed, including the
vast uncertainties in ASGM Hg emission estimates. This thesis was partly
motivated by the lack of sufficient atmospheric monitoring in most
regions where ASGM is prevalent and the absence of modeling studies
evaluating Hg emissions from regions with high ASGM emissions.
Furthermore, Chapters 2 and 3 showed how data from different Hg
atmospheric concentration monitoring technologies could be leveraged and
integrated with the GEOS-Chem CTM results to investigate ASGM Hg
pollution. Chapter 2 compared the temporal and spatial characteristics
of observed and modeled atmospheric Hg concentrations. PAS GEM
measurements provided helpful information about the distribution of Hg
concentrations across Latin America. Additionally, it was discussed that
a network of PAS provides high-quality data while being accessible and
affordable to deploy. However, PAS is limited because it does not
provide continuous data about atmospheric Hg concentrations. On the
other hand, active sampling techniques such as those conducted by the
GMOS Network provided valuable time series data about the atmospheric Hg
concentrations. These data enabled broader analysis through the
utilization of more metrics to evaluate Hg emissions and better
understand temporal variations of Hg concentrations in the atmosphere.
By combining active monitoring stations with models, it may be possible
to improve understanding of mercury levels in the atmosphere and better
define source-receptor relationships.</p>

<p>According to Evers et al., country-specific actions under Article 7 of
the MC will differ from country to country, and this variability poses a
challenge to assessing the MC’s effectiveness. Additionally, they argue
that understanding changes in the overall use of Hg in the global ASGM
sector can be informed by tracking progress in individual countries.
They suggest a compilation, visualization, and mapping of the respective
data to track this progress across ASGM countries. The value added by
baseline estimates of emissions to policy making is also recognized in
the MC’s paragraph 3 of Article 7, which stipulates that each party that
notifies the secretariat that (ASGM) and processing in its territory is
more than insignificant shall develop and implement a national action
plan (NAP) per annex C to the MC. In addition, annex C (d) states that
the NAP shall include baseline estimates of the quantities of Hg used
and the practices employed in ASGM and processing. As of this writing,
18 countries have submitted their respective NAPs. The estimates of how
much Hg is used in their territories are shown in
<a class="reference internal" href="#global-hg-emissions-estimates-vs-nap-estimates"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 2.1</span></a>, which

<p>In <a class="reference internal" href="#global-hg-emissions-estimates-vs-nap-estimates"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 2.1</span></a>, it
is evident that the difference between the global estimates and the NAP
estimates is vast for some countries. While the baseline estimates of Hg
use in ASGM as reported in the NAPs and global inventories are critical,
data from monitoring networks combined with atmospheric models provide
additional tools to evaluate the changes in Hg in the atmosphere. The
differences in the estimates do not necessarily indicate emission
increases, but they reflect the uncertainties in the global emission
estimates.</p>

<p>Monitoring atmospheric concentrations of pollutants of interest and
using atmospheric models to understand the data has been critical in
evaluating global legally-binding environmental agreements such as the
Montreal Protocol. For instance, Rigby et al. 2019 showed how vital the
combination of atmospheric monitoring networks and modeling is when they
quantified the amount of an observed increase in CFC-11 and identified
where the source was located. They used high-frequency atmospheric
observations from Gosan, South Korea, and Hateruma, Japan, and global
monitoring data and atmospheric CTM simulations to investigate regional
CFC-11 emissions from eastern Asia.</p>
<p>The above example about the Montreal protocol showcases the multiple
benefits of atmospheric monitoring and modeling. For instance, Rigby et
al.(2019) showed that emissions from eastern mainland China were 7.0 ± 3.0 (±1
standard deviation) gigagrams per year higher in 2014–2017 than in
2008–2012 and that the increase in emissions arose primarily around
the northeastern provinces of Shandong and Hebei <span id="id1">[<a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#id91" title="M. Rigby, S. Park, T. Saito, L. M. Western, A. L. Redington, X.

of emission estimates and the approximate location of their sources
would be beneficial for evaluating the effectiveness of MC efforts aimed
at reducing Hg emissions. Policymakers would value such information
because it would give them precise data about the amounts of emissions
and where they should look for the sources. However, it is uncertain if
this level of precision could be achieved for an emission source like
ASGM, given that it is not a point source.</p>
<p>Another critical aspect of the information provided by the approach
discussed in this thesis is the ability to determine areas that have a
low likelihood of being sources of increase in emissions. This benefit
was also demonstrated by Rigby et al. (2019) in that they could conclude
that there was no evidence for a significant rise in CFC-11 emissions
from any other eastern Asian countries or other regions of the world
where there are available data for the detection of regional emissions<span id="id2">[<a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#id91" title="M. Rigby, S. Park, T. Saito, L. M. Western, A.

<p>A look at China’s response to scientific information about its increased
CFC emissions in the Montreal Protocol example above may provide insight
into possible answers by parties when they are notified about emission
violations within their territory. China questioned the conclusions of
the scientific study noting significant uncertainty. However, they also
acknowledged the importance of atmospheric monitoring. They developed a
plan to establish a national monitoring network, including substantial
penalties for companies that produce insulation foam for ozone-depleting
chemicals illegally. Considering that ASGM occurs mainly in poor
communities in countries in the global south, the Minamata Convention
may need to develop a different strategy for helping countries respond
to sudden increases in their ASGM emission sources. For instance, PAS
technologies could be deployed at locations of interest once regional
active monitoring networks and models have identified spikes in ASGM Hg
emissions. Lawmakers should rely on legal measures to curb emissions,
such as banning mercury or restricting ASGM communities as a last
resort. These command-and-control strategies have been shown to dissuade
miners from cooperating.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">2.4. </span>Recommendations<a class="headerlink" href="#recommendations" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>As part of monitoring ASGM activities and defining policy related to
ASGM activities, government officials and policymakers are encouraged to
include atmospheric monitoring. Governments may be able to set up
monitoring within their territories by using PAS technologies. Moreover,
governments are encouraged to establish regional active monitoring
stations in collaboration at the regional level. According to chapter
three, a reasonable estimation of emissions can be made based on data
from one station. In this way, a few regional active monitoring networks
and widespread national PAS networks may prove helpful for evaluating
the effectiveness of MC activities.</p>
<p>The monitoring of atmospheric Hg can provide information about ASGM
activities and help identify them. As a result, these data can be used
to establish a baseline of mercury use in ASGM and to evaluate policies
related to reducing it. Through cartographic and statistical products,
monitoring and modeling outputs can be understandable to non-technical
audiences, thus facilitating artisanal mining policy development.</p>
<p>Modeling the atmosphere using CTMs requires technical skills not usually
available in government agencies or policy agencies because it requires
technical competencies typically found in scientific communities.
Consequently, investing in capacity building among mining
administrations lacking technical knowledge and soliciting researchers’
know-how from local universities are critical recommendations for
government officials and policymakers.</p>
<p>It is necessary to consider that technical competency is not always
present in local communities and mining associations. As a result, their
involvement in monitoring programs and policy development may be reduced
or compromised. Tensions can sometimes be exacerbated by this, which
undermines local trust. Therefore, government officials and policymakers
should include local communities and artisanal miners when developing
ASGM policies and programs.</p>

<h2><span class="section-number">2.5. </span>Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Chapter four built upon the findings of the previous three chapters. We
referenced one of this thesis’s primary motivations, detailed in chapter
one, where we discussed the nature of ASGM activities and their
estimated contribution to the global Hg budget. We also highlighted
chapters 2 and 3 of this thesis, which addressed the first two questions
by demonstrating how data from different technologies for monitoring Hg
concentrations in the atmosphere can be leveraged and integrated with
the GEOS-Chem CTM outputs to investigate Hg pollution from ASGM
activities. Moreover, we showed that combining active monitoring
stations with models may improve understanding of mercury levels in the
atmosphere and better define source-receptor relationships. By comparing
the GMA 2018 estimates with the NAP estimates provided by countries, we
proposed that atmospheric monitoring and modeling can provide additional
constraints on emissions sources in policy-making.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Montreal Protocol was cited as an example of how
atmospheric monitoring and modeling are valuable in effective
policy-making and ensuring that parties take responsibility for
violations of treaty obligations. However, it may be politically
controversial depending on how parties perceive it. Lastly, we suggested
countries engage in regional active monitoring that uses both PAS and
active tracking, referring to the third chapter of this thesis, where we
analyzed active monitoring data to produce the first top-down estimates
of ASGM mercury pollution.</p>
