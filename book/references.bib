  abstract = {© 2017 ACM. There is an increasing interest in learning outside of the traditional classroom setting. This is especially true for topics covering computational tools and data science, as both are challenging to incorporate in the standard curriculum. These atypical learning environments offer new opportunities for teaching, particularly when it comes to combining conceptual knowledge with hands-on experience/expertise with methods and skills. Advances in cloud computing and containerized environments provide an attractive opportunity to improve the effciency and ease with which students can learn. This manuscript details recent advances towards using commonly-Available cloud computing services and advanced cyberinfrastructure support for improving the learning experience in bootcamp-style events. We cover the benets (and challenges) of using a server hosted remotely instead of relying on student laptops, discuss the technology that was used in order to make this possible, and give suggestions for how others could implement and improve upon this model for pedagogy and reproducibility.},

  abstract = {© 2017 Holdgraf, Rieger, Micheli, Martin, Knight and Theunissen. Cognitive neuroscience has seen rapid growth in the size and complexity of data recorded from the human brain as well as in the computational tools available to analyze this data. This data explosion has resulted in an increased use of multivariate, model-based methods for asking neuroscience questions, allowing scientists to investigate multiple hypotheses with a single dataset, to use complex, time-varying stimuli, and to study the human brain under more naturalistic conditions. These tools come in the form of “Encoding” models, in which stimulus features are used to model brain activity, and “Decoding” models, in which neural features are used to generated a stimulus output. Here we review the current state of encoding and decoding models in cognitive electrophysiology and provide a practical guide toward conducting experiments and analyses in this emerging field. Our examples focus on using linear models in the study of human language and audition. We show how to calculate auditory receptive fields from natural sounds as well as how to decode neural recordings to predict speech. The paper aims to be a useful tutorial to these approaches, and a practical introduction to using machine learning and applied statistics to build models of neural activity. The data analytic approaches we discuss may also be applied to other sensory modalities, motor systems, and cognitive systems, and we cover some examples in these areas. In addition, a collection of Jupyter notebooks is publicly available as a complement to the material covered in this paper, providing code examples and tutorials for predictive modeling in python. The aimis to provide a practical understanding of predictivemodeling of human brain data and to propose best-practices in conducting these analyses.},

	abstract = {Artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) utilizes mercury (Hg) for the extraction of gold (Au) and is responsible for the largest anthropogenic source of emissions and releases of Hg to the environment. Previous estimates of Hg use in ASGM have varied widely. In this effort, Hg losses in ASGM were derived from the difference between estimates of total Au production and the production reported by conventional gold mining. On the basis of this result, the average ratio of Hg lost to Au produced in ASGM was estimated to be 1.96 in Africa, 4.63 in Latin America, and 1.23 in Asia. The difference among regions can be attributed to the amalgamation procedure used by the miners, in which whole-ore amalgamation is predominant in Latin America and Asia. The obtained estimated ratio of Hglost:Auproduced suggested the possibility to detect either Au or Hg smuggling from one country to another. On the other hand, the importance of considering cyanidation in ASGM was also suggested.},

	abstract = {Small-scale gold mining activities and their mercury emissions in the Gorontalo Utara Regency of the Gorontalo Province, Sulawesi Island, Indonesia, have been studied. The mining occurs in many areas of this region, but especially in the three villages Hulawa, Ilangata and Ilangata Barat. Mining activities in the Hulawa village are the oldest (19th century) in the regency, whereas mining in the Ilangata village began just 15 years ago. The activity level changes rapidly from time to time depending on the fluctuations of the gold market. Women and children are involved in the gold mining process. Female workers crush ore, process sediment wastes, and pan for gold in rivers. Children assist their mothers in these activities and play around the mining sites. Gold mining in the Utara Regency is estimated to produce about 290 kg of gold and emits approximately 860 kg of mercury into the environment annually. The impact of such large mercury release into the environment have caused environmental degradation and contamination of fish as food for humans. Collaborative works of stakeholders are urgently needed to find solutions to the problems related to small-scale gold mining such as marginalization and environmental pollution.},

	abstract = {The gold ore mined by artisanal and small-scale miners in Portovelo-Zaruma, Ecuador, is processed in custom mills. Miners can choose between Chilean-mill processing centers, where the ore is ground, concentrated and amalgamated, or “Chancha” Centers, where the whole ore is amalgamated. By weighing mercury before and after all unit operations involved in the amalgamation process, it was possible to determine mercury losses. Analyses in eight centers indicated that 51–59\% of mercury introduced into the amalgamation process is recovered when miners squeeze the excess mercury. Around 29\% of total mercury is lost when miners burn amalgam and gold is melted, and 15\% is lost with the tailings. When only gravity concentrates are amalgamated, 1.4\% of mercury entering the process is lost with tailings, whereas 29.5\% is lost when the whole ore is amalgamated. Approximately 1.5 tonnes/annum of mercury is released in Portovelo-Zaruma, from which 70\% is evaporated and 30\% is released with tailings. Mercury-contaminated tailings are leached with cyanide in agitated tanks. A large majority of the processing centers dispose the final tailings with mercury and cyanide into the Calera River and Amarillo River. Mercury dissolved with cyanide likely becomes more bioavailable than metallic mercury. A campaign for reducing mercury emissions must focus on the use of individual retorts – mercury pollution control devices – and the elimination of whole ore amalgamation.},

This paper reports findings from an environmental analysis undertaken directly within three small-scale gold mining sites in Ghana. Using targeted soil and water sampling analysed through mass spectrometry, the findings are compared with findings in the literature and safety guidelines to gauge the scale of contamination at surveyed sites. The analysis reveals that there is widespread pollution, often several orders higher than background levels.

	abstract = {Speciated mercury gridded emissions inventories together with chemical transport models and concentration measurements are essential when investigating both the effectiveness of mitigation measures and the mercury cycle in the environment. Since different mercury species have contrasting behaviour in the atmosphere, their proportion in anthropogenic emissions could determine the spatial impacts. In this study, the time series from 1970 to 2012 of the EDGARv4.tox2 global mercury emissions inventory are described; the total global mercury emission in 2010 is 1772 tonnes. Global grid-maps with geospatial distribution of mercury emissions at a 0.1° × 0.1° resolution are provided for each year. Compared to the previous tox1 version, tox2 provides updates for more recent years and improved emissions in particular for agricultural waste burning, power generation and artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) sectors. We have also developed three retrospective emissions scenarios based on different hypotheses related to the proportion of mercury species in the total mercury emissions for each activity sector; improvements in emissions speciation are seen when using information primarily from field measurements. We evaluated them using the GEOS-Chem 3-D mercury model in order to explore the influence of speciation shifts, to reactive mercury forms in particular, on regional wet deposition patterns. The reference scenario S1 (EDGARv4.tox2\_S1) uses speciation factors from the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP); scenario S2 (“EPA\_power”) uses factors from EPA's Information Collection Request (ICR); and scenario S3 (“Asia\_filedM”) factors from recent scientific publications. In the reference scenario, the sum of reactive mercury emissions (Hg-P and Hg2+) accounted for 25.3\% of the total global emissions; the regions/countries that have shares of reactive mercury emissions higher than 6\% in total global reactive mercury are China+ (30.9\%), India+ (12.5\%) and the United States (9.9\%). In 2010, the variations of reactive mercury emissions amongst the different scenarios are in the range of −19.3 t/yr (China+) to 4.4 t/yr (OECD\_Europe). However, at the sector level, the variation could be different, e.g., for the iron and steel industry in China reaches 15.4 t/yr. Model evaluation at the global level shows a variation of approximately ±10\% in wet deposition for the three emissions scenarios. An evaluation of the impact of mercury speciation within nested grid sensitivity simulations is performed for the United States and modelled wet deposition fluxes are compared with measurements. These studies show that using the S2 and S3 emissions of reactive mercury, can improve wet deposition estimates near sources.},

            Mercury is a globally transported pollutant with potent neurotoxic effects for both humans and wildlife. This study introduces an assessment method to estimate the potential human health-related economic benefits of global and domestic mercury control policies. It finds that for the US population as a whole, global mercury controls could lead to approximately twice the benefits of domestic action by 2050. This result is robust to several uncertainties and variabilities along the emissions-to-impacts path, although we find that those consuming locally caught freshwater fish in the United States could benefit more from domestic action.
          , 
            Mercury pollution poses risks for both human and ecosystem health. As a consequence, controlling mercury pollution has become a policy goal on both global and national scales. We developed an assessment method linking global-scale atmospheric chemical transport modeling to regional-scale economic modeling to consistently evaluate the potential benefits to the United States of global (UN Minamata Convention on Mercury) and domestic [Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS)] policies, framed as economic gains from avoiding mercury-related adverse health endpoints. This method attempts to trace the policies-to-impacts path while taking into account uncertainties and knowledge gaps with policy-appropriate bounding assumptions. We project that cumulative lifetime benefits from the Minamata Convention for individuals affected by 2050 are \$339 billion (2005 USD), with a range from \$1.4 billion to \$575 billion in our sensitivity scenarios. Cumulative economy-wide benefits to the United States, realized by 2050, are \$104 billion, with a range from \$6 million to \$171 billion. Projected Minamata benefits are more than twice those projected from the domestic policy. This relative benefit is robust to several uncertainties and variabilities, with the ratio of benefits (Minamata/MATS) ranging from ≈1.4 to 3. However, we find that for those consuming locally caught freshwater fish from the United States, rather than marine and estuarine fish from the global market, benefits are larger from US than global action, suggesting domestic policies are important for protecting these populations. Per megagram of prevented emissions, our domestic policy scenario results in US benefits about an order of magnitude higher than from our global scenario, further highlighting the importance of domestic action.},

              A global surge in ‘artisanal’, smallscale mining (ASM) threatens biodiverse tropical forests and exposes residents to dangerous levels of mercury. In response, governments and development agencies are investing millions (USD) on ASM
              formalization
              ; registering concessions and demarcating extraction zones to promote regulatory adherence and direct mining away from ecologically sensitive areas. The environmental outcomes of these initiatives are seldom systematically assessed. We examine patterns of mining-related deforestation associated with formalization efforts in a gold-rich region of the Peruvian Amazon. We track changes from 2001 to 2014 when agencies: (a) issued 1701 provisional titles and (b) tried to restrict mining to a {\textgreater}5000 km
              2
              ‘corridor’. We use fixed-effect regression models and matching methods to control for gold price, geology, and accessibility. Mining increased dramatically during this period, clearing ∼40 000 ha of forest. After the mining corridor was declared and enforcement increased, new mining sites were opened more frequently within titled areas and inside the corridor than elsewhere. However, mining also increased in protected area buffer zones and native communities, and the proportion of mining area occurring outside the corridor grew, concentrated in a few hotspots. Interviews (
              n
              = 47) revealed that the hoped-for regulatory adherence failed to materialize because miners who were issued provisional titles started operations without complying with attendant environmental rules. Overlapping land claims for agriculture and forest extraction proved a major obstacle for obtaining full legal rights to mine. Miners resented the slow, costly formalization process but many sought titles to bolster territorial claims, avoid policing, obtain credit and recruit paying ‘guest’ miners who generally ignored regulations. We find that responses to formalization varied with changing context and while formalization may curb mining in some circumstances, it may exacerbate it in others. Without adequate enforcement, interagency coordination, and attention to competing land claims, formalizing ASM may accelerate ecological destruction.},

	abstract = {Abstract. High-quality atmospheric mercury (Hg) data are rare for South America,
especially for its tropical region. As a consequence, mercury dynamics are still
highly uncertain in this region. This is a significant deficiency, as South America
appears to play a major role in the global budget of this toxic pollutant.
To address this issue, we performed nearly 2 years (July 2014–February 2016) of continuous high-resolution total gaseous mercury (TGM) measurements
at the Chacaltaya (CHC) mountain site in the Bolivian Andes, which is
subject to a diverse mix of air masses coming predominantly from the
Altiplano and the Amazon rainforest. For the first 11 months of
measurements, we obtained a mean TGM concentration of 0.89±0.01 ng m−3, which is in good agreement with the sparse amount of data available from
the continent. For the remaining 9 months, we obtained a significantly
higher TGM concentration of 1.34±0.01 ng m−3, a difference which
we tentatively attribute to the strong El Niño event of 2015–2016.
Based on HYSPLIT (Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory) back trajectories and clustering techniques, we show that
lower mean TGM concentrations were linked to either westerly Altiplanic air
masses or those originating from the lowlands to the southeast of CHC.
Elevated TGM concentrations were related to northerly air masses of
Amazonian or southerly air masses of Altiplanic origin, with the former possibly
linked to artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM), whereas the latter
might be explained by volcanic activity. We observed a marked seasonal
pattern, with low TGM concentrations in the dry season (austral winter),
rising concentrations during the biomass burning (BB) season, and the highest
concentrations at the beginning of the wet season (austral summer). With the
help of simultaneously sampled equivalent black carbon (eBC) and carbon
monoxide (CO) data, we use the clearly BB-influenced signal during the BB season
(August to October) to derive a mean TGM / CO emission ratio of (2.3±0.6)×10-7 ppbvTGM ppbvCO-1, which could be used to
constrain South American BB emissions. Through the link with CO2 measured in situ and remotely sensed solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) as
proxies for vegetation activity, we detect signs of a vegetation sink effect
in Amazonian air masses and derive a “best guess” TGM / CO2 uptake ratio of 0.058 ±0.017 (ng m−3)TGM ppmCO2-1. Finally, significantly
higher Hg concentrations in western Altiplanic air masses during the wet
season compared with the dry season point towards the modulation of
atmospheric Hg by the eastern Pacific Ocean.},

Evaluating the effectiveness of the Convention (as required by Article 22) is a crucial component to ensure that it meets this objective. We describe an approach to measure effectiveness, which includes a suite of short-, medium-, and long-term metrics related to ﬁve major mercury control Articles in the Convention, as well as metrics derived from monitoring of mercury in the environment using select bioindicators, including people. The use of existing biotic Hg data will deﬁne spatial gradients (e.g., biological mercury hotspots), baselines to develop relevant temporal trends, and an ability to assess risk to taxa and human communities of greatest concern.

In the present study, the provisions of the Minamata Convention are examined to assess their influence on global biogeochemical cycling of Hg. Although the convention's scope covers all major categories of atmospheric emissions, the degree to which it will affect future emissions trajectories remains unclear. A box model analysis shows that future global biogeochemical cycling under projected technological provisions would result mainly in avoided increases and that estimated differences in atmospheric concentrations resulting from policies would be on the order of 1\% to 2\% per year. Present experience suggests that scientific knowledge is not currently sufficient to attribute causes to changes of this magnitude.

Managing boundaries between disciplines, across scales of geography and jurisdiction, and between different forms of knowledge is also often critical to transferring information. The research presented in this paper finds that information requires three (not mutually exclusive) attributes – salience, credibility, and legitimacy – and that what makes boundary crossing difficult is that actors on different sides of a boundary perceive and value salience, credibility, and legitimacy differently. Presenting research on water management regimes in the United States, international agricultural research systems, El Niño forecasting systems in the Pacific and southern Africa, and fisheries in the North Atlantic, this paper explores: 1) how effective boundary work involves creating salient, credible, and legitimate information simultaneously for multiple audiences; 2) the thresholds, complementarities and tradeoffs between salience, credibility, and legitimacy when crossing boundaries; and 3) propositions for institutional mechanisms in boundary organizations which effectively balance tradeoffs, take advantage on complementarities, and reach thresholds of salience, credibility, and legitimacy.},

Rapidly increasing global prices for gold are causing a massive upsurge in artisanal mining in the Peruvian Amazon, considered to be one of the most biodiverse places on the planet. This study identifies the current levels of mercury in the human population, through identifying levels of total mercury in human hair in mining zones of Madre de Dios Department and in the nearby city of Puerto Maldonado. A regression analysis reveals that fish consumption, gender, and location of residence were significant indicators of mercury levels; while duration of residence and age had no significant relationship to mercury levels. Increased fish consumption levels were the strongest indicators of increased total mercury levels across the entire population. The levels of total mercury in hair was significantly (a = 0.05) higher in mining zones, than Puerto Maldonado. In both areas men had significantly higher levels than women, likely due to a difference in metabolism or varying levels of direct involvement in gold mining- a male predominated industry. This is the first study to show the health threat that mercury poses to this region, however further research needs to be done to gain a more refined understanding of the predominant routes of exposure in this population.},

We selected only the most relevant articles from the thousands of articles that were generated by the Divine Word University (DWU) electronic data base system for our review. Further screening questions were applied based on the CASP method which filtered remaining 105 to only 9 papers for the review. The results from the nine (N = 9) studies analysed showed convincing results of the association between consumption of fish contaminated with methyl mercury and poor growth and development in children whose parents lived near mining sites. We conclude that since mercury is the predominant element used in the extraction of gold in alluvial mining, it is an exposure pathway for methyl mercury toxicity for children through dietary exposure.},

          , 
            
              Mercury (Hg), a neurotoxic heavy metal, is transferred to marine and terrestrial ecosystems through atmospheric transport. Recent studies have highlighted the role of vegetation uptake as a sink for atmospheric elemental mercury (Hg
              0

              0
              vegetation uptake flux is highly uncertain, with estimates ranging 1000–4000 Mg per year. To constrain this sink, we compare simulations in the chemical transport model GEOS-Chem with a compiled database of litterfall, throughfall, and flux tower measurements from 93 forested sites. The prior version of GEOS-Chem predicts median Hg
              0
              dry deposition velocities similar to litterfall measurements from Northern hemisphere temperate and boreal forests (∼0.03 cm s
              −1
              ), yet it underestimates measurements from a flux tower study (0.04 cm s
              −1
              vs.
              0.07 cm s

              0.17 cm s
              −1
              ). After revising the Hg

              observations in the Northern midlatitudes. Additionally, the modelled bias in Hg
              0

              land sink, yet continued deforestation and climate change threatens the rainforest's stability and thus its role as an important Hg sink. In an illustrative worst-case scenario where the Amazon is completely converted to savannah, GEOS-Chem predicts that an additional 283 Mg Hg per year would deposit to the ocean, where it can bioaccumulate in the marine food chain. Biosphere–atmosphere interactions thus play a crucial role in global Hg cycling and should be considered in assessments of future Hg pollution.},

Passive air samplers (PAS) are an accessible method for monitoring gaseous elemental mercury (GEM). I tested the suitability of PAS for recording GEM gradients at widely varying scales. Vertical gradients on the scale of centimeters to tens of meters measured over soil and within a forest allowed for the observation of GEM uptake in growing vegetation, the determination of the air-surface exchange direction, and the estimation of evaporative fluxes from contaminated soil. When PAS were deployed above a field with known soil contamination, slightly different spatial contamination patterns suggest horizontal GEM advection. on a continental scale, the PAS were also used to map annually averaged GEM levels across South and Central America. Accounting for the effect of wind speed on the PAS sampling rate is necessary to distinguish small concentration differences.},

The physical and chemical transformations of various mercury species in the atmosphere strongly influence their composition, phase, transport characteristics and deposition rate to the ground. Modeling efforts to evaluate the mercury cycling in the environment require an accurate understanding of atmospheric mercury chemistry. We focus this article on recent studies (since 2015) on improving our understanding of the atmospheric chemistry of mercury. We discuss recent advances in (i) determining the dominant atmospheric oxidant of elemental mercury (Hg0); (ii) understanding the oxidation reactions of Hg0 by halogen atoms and by nitrate radical (NO3); (iii) the aqueous reduction of oxidized mercury compounds (HgII); and (iv) the heterogeneous reactions of Hg on atmospherically-relevant surfaces. The need for future research to improve understanding of the fate and transformation of mercury in the atmosphere is also discussed.},

	abstract = {Abstract We compare atmospheric temperature changes in satellite data and in model ensembles performed under phases 5 and 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5 and CMIP6). In the lower stratosphere, multidecadal stratospheric cooling during the period of strong ozone depletion is smaller in newer CMIP6 simulations than in CMIP5 or satellite data. In the troposphere, however, despite forcing and climate sensitivity differences between the two CMIP ensembles, their ensemble-average global warming over 1979–2019 is very similar. We also examine four properties of tropical behavior governed by basic physical processes. The first three are ratios between trends in water vapor (WV) and trends in sea surface temperature (SST), lower-tropospheric temperature (TLT), and mid- to upper-tropospheric temperature (TMT). The fourth property is the ratio between TMT and SST trends. All four ratios are tightly constrained in CMIP simulations but diverge markedly in observations. Model trend ratios between WV and temperature are closest to observed ratios when the latter are calculated with datasets exhibiting larger tropical warming of the ocean surface and troposphere. For the TMT/SST ratio, model–data consistency depends on the combination of observations used to estimate TMT and SST trends. If model expectations of these four covariance relationships are realistic, our findings reflect either a systematic low bias in satellite tropospheric temperature trends or an overestimate of the observed atmospheric moistening signal. It is currently difficult to determine which interpretation is more credible. Nevertheless, our analysis reveals anomalous covariance behavior in several observational datasets and illustrates the diagnostic power of simultaneously considering multiple complementary variables.},

	abstract = {In support of international efforts to reduce mercury (Hg) exposure in humans and wildlife, this paper reviews the literature concerning global Hg emissions, cycling and fate, and presents revised global and oceanic Hg budgets for the 2018 United Nations Global Mercury Assessment. We assessed two competing scenarios about the impacts of 16th – late 19th century New World silver (Ag) mining, which may be the largest human source of atmospheric Hg in history. Consideration of Ag ore geochemistry, historical documents on Hg use, and comparison of the scenarios against atmospheric Hg patterns in environmental archives, strongly support a “low mining emission” scenario. Building upon this scenario and other published work, the revised global budget estimates human activities including recycled legacy emissions have increased current atmospheric Hg concentrations by about 450\% above natural levels (prevailing before 1450 AD). Current anthropogenic emissions to air are 2.5 ± 0.5 kt/y. The increase in atmospheric Hg concentrations has driven a ∼ 300\% average increase in deposition, and a 230\% increase in surface marine waters. Deeper marine waters show increases of only 12–25\%. The overall increase in Hg in surface organic soils (∼15\%) is small due to the large mass of natural Hg already present from rock weathering, but this figure varies regionally. Specific research recommendations are made to reduce uncertainties, particularly through improved understanding of fundamental processes of the Hg cycle, and continued improvements in emissions inventories from large natural and anthropogenic sources.},

To address these problems, several attempts - policy formulation, formalisation and introduction of technical assistance - have been undertaken by the government of Ghana and other international bodies such as United Nations Industrial Development Organisation-UNIDO. Despite these attempts, majority of artisanal small-scale miners are not registered and even some registered miners together with unregistered miners indulge in unacceptable mining practices. Premised on these, the study sought to undertake a thorough review of the challenges associated with the management of ASM in Ghana and provide a framework for the effective management of the sector. Consequently, a three-pronged approach (problem analysis, planning and implementation and enforcement) with a cross-cutting focus on monitoring and evaluation is recommended.},

	abstract = {We review recent progress in our understanding of the global cycling of mercury (Hg), including best estimates of Hg concentrations and pool sizes in major environmental compartments and exchange processes within and between these reservoirs. Recent advances include the availability of new global datasets covering areas of the world where environmental Hg data were previously lacking; integration of these data into global and regional models is continually improving estimates of global Hg cycling. New analytical techniques, such as Hg stable isotope characterization, provide novel constraints of sources and transformation processes. The major global Hg reservoirs that are, and continue to be, affected by anthropogenic activities include the atmosphere (4.4–5.3 Gt), terrestrial environments (particularly soils: 250–1000 Gg), and aquatic ecosystems (e.g., oceans: 270–450 Gg). Declines in anthropogenic Hg emissions between 1990 and 2010 have led to declines in atmospheric Hg0 concentrations and HgII wet deposition in Europe and the US (− 1.5 to − 2.2\% per year). Smaller atmospheric Hg0 declines (− 0.2\% per year) have been reported in high northern latitudes, but not in the southern hemisphere, while increasing atmospheric Hg loads are still reported in East Asia. New observations and updated models now suggest high concentrations of oxidized HgII in the tropical and subtropical free troposphere where deep convection can scavenge these HgII reservoirs. As a result, up to 50\% of total global wet HgII deposition has been predicted to occur to tropical oceans. Ocean Hg0 evasion is a large source of present-day atmospheric Hg (approximately 2900 Mg/year; range 1900–4200 Mg/year). Enhanced seawater Hg0 levels suggest enhanced Hg0 ocean evasion in the intertropical convergence zone, which may be linked to high HgII deposition. Estimates of gaseous Hg0 emissions to the atmosphere over land, long considered a critical Hg source, have been revised downward, and most terrestrial environments now are considered net sinks of atmospheric Hg due to substantial Hg uptake by plants. Litterfall deposition by plants is now estimated at 1020–1230 Mg/year globally. Stable isotope analysis and direct flux measurements provide evidence that in many ecosystems Hg0 deposition via plant inputs dominates, accounting for 57–94\% of Hg in soils. Of global aquatic Hg releases, around 50\% are estimated to occur in China and India, where Hg drains into the West Pacific and North Indian Oceans. A first inventory of global freshwater Hg suggests that inland freshwater Hg releases may be dominated by artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM; approximately 880 Mg/year), industrial and wastewater releases (220 Mg/year), and terrestrial mobilization (170–300 Mg/year). For pelagic ocean regions, the dominant source of Hg is atmospheric deposition; an exception is the Arctic Ocean, where riverine and coastal erosion is likely the dominant source. Ocean water Hg concentrations in the North Atlantic appear to have declined during the last several decades but have increased since the mid-1980s in the Pacific due to enhanced atmospheric deposition from the Asian continent. Finally, we provide examples of ongoing and anticipated changes in Hg cycling due to emission, climate, and land use changes. It is anticipated that future emissions changes will be strongly dependent on ASGM, as well as energy use scenarios and technology requirements implemented under the Minamata Convention. We predict that land use and climate change impacts on Hg cycling will be large and inherently linked to changes in ecosystem function and global atmospheric and ocean circulations. Our ability to predict multiple and simultaneous changes in future Hg global cycling and human exposure is rapidly developing but requires further enhancement.},

	abstract = {Ratification of the Minamata Convention on Mercury has led to the establishment of Peruvian regulations limiting mercury concentrations in air to 2000 ng/m3over a 24-hr measurement period. As a result, three communities in Madre de Dios, Peru were mapped during October 2017 to determine Hg0 vapor concentrations in the air. The town of Tres Islas exhibited Hg0 concentrations less than 200 ng/m3: the minimum risk level defined by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. These low concentrations were reflective of a town in the region with limited exposure to artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM). However, the ASGM communities of Laberinto and Delta One exhibited concentrations of Hg0 vapor that exceeded 2,000,000 ng/m3 surrounding active gold shops, where amalgams and processed amalgams were heated with open flames.

	abstract = {Background: Mercury (Hg) is used in gold mining to extract gold from ore by forming “amalgam”—a mixture composed of approximately equal parts mercury and gold. Approximately 15 million people, including approximately 3 million women and children, participate in artisanal small-scale gold mining (ASGM) in developing countries. Thirty-seven percent of global air emissions of Hg are produced by ASGM. The recently adopted Minamata Convention calls for nations to gather health data, train health-care workers, and raise awareness in regard to ASGM activity., Objective: The purpose of our review was to evaluate the current literature regarding the health effects of Hg among those working and/or living in or near ASGM communities., Methods: We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar for studies relating to health effects and biomarkers of Hg exposure in ASGM communities. Articles published from 1990 through December 2012 were evaluated for relevance., Discussion: Studies reporting health assessments, kidney dysfunction, neurological disorders and symptoms, and immunotoxicity/autoimmune dysfunction in individuals living in or near an ASGM community were identified. More than 60 studies that measured biomarkers of Hg exposure in individuals living in or near ASGM communities were also identified. These studies, conducted in 19 different countries in South America, Asia, and Africa, demonstrated that hair and urine concentrations are well above World Health Organization health guidance values in ASGM communities., Conclusions: ASGM workers and their families are exposed to Hg vapor, and workers, workers’ families, and residents of nearby and downstream communities are consuming fish heavily contaminated with methylmercury., Citation: Gibb H, O’Leary KG. 2014.

	abstract = {With the aim of protecting human life and the environment, the Minamata Convention seeks to reduce and monitor mercury (Hg) concentrations in the environment. Artisanal and Small-scale Gold Mining (ASGM) has been identified as the most important anthropogenic source of Hg at a global scale and an important route of human exposure to Hg. In this context, this study assessed total Hg (THg) in blood, urine and hair, and methylmercury (MeHg) in human hair samples from 238 participants with occupational exposure to Hg in the most relevant ASGM communities of Colombia. Mercury concentrations in different biological matrices were related to several variables of interest such as age, gender, body mass index, fish consumption, exposure time, and specific occupational activities, such as amalgamation and amalgam burning. The median values of THg in blood (3.70 µg/L), urine (4.00 µg/L) and hair (1.37 mg/kg), and hair MeHg (1.47 mg/kg) for all participants were below permissible concentrations set by WHO. However, about 40\% of the miners showed Hg concentrations in blood, urine and/or hair above the WHO thresholds. In all the biological matrices studied, miners burning amalgams showed significantly higher concentrations than miners who did not burn amalgams, with values 7-, 7-, and 8-fold higher in blood, urine and hair, respectively. A multiple linear regression model revealed that burning amalgam and fish consumption were significant predictors of Hg exposure in miners. Miners from Guainía had the highest concentrations in urine and hair, most likely due to the high manipulation and burning of amalgam, and a high fish consumption. In contrast, miners from Caldas showed the lowest Hg concentrations in all the biomarkers because they do not manipulate or burn amalgam, as well as reporting the lowest fish consumption. Our study also highlighted that gold miners exposure to Hg depends on their work practices. Therefore, the implementation of a health education programme on gold mining strategies is required, especially in Guaina, Vaupés, Córdoba, and Antioquia departments.},

To assess the effectiveness of the convention in the future, better constraints about the current mercury emissions is a premise. In our study, we applied a top-down approach to quantify mercury emissions on the basis of atmospheric mercury measurements conducted at the remote high altitude monitoring station Jungfraujoch, Switzerland. We established the source-receptor relationships and by the means of atmospheric inversion we were able to quantify spatially resolved European emissions of 89 ± 14 t/a for elemental mercury. Our European emission estimate is 17\% higher than the bottom-up emission inventory, which is within stated uncertainties. However, some regions with unexpectedly high emissions were identified. Stationary combustion, in particular in coal-fired power plants, is found to be the main responsible sector for increased emission estimates. Our top-down approach, based on measurements, provides an independent constraint on mercury emissions, helps to improve and refine reported emission inventories, and can serve for continued assessment of future changes in emissions independent from bottom-up inventories.},

	abstract = {Many reports have been written about the issues surrounding small scale miners’ challenges in Namibia; yet little has been done to address these challenges. There has been a fragmented approach to address these challenges. Various government arms and donororganizationshave utilizedpiece meal methods in the past in trying to make improvements on the productivities across the sector, but with no meaningful success.This has led to the design and implementation of inappropriate technologies and support services for the sector. The structures of many of the semi-precious stones mining businesses are informal, with very little royalties received by the government. Miners often work informally or illegally andthey fear government interference and they distrustoutsiders, resulting in them withholding production information. The presence of small scale miners is quite often associated with major challenges, including poor safety and environmental management standards, the spread of communicable diseases and poorworking conditions. The majority of the miners employ uncontrolled extraction techniques which damage the crystals and mineral specimens, resulting in intermediate and final products of low quality along with high wastage at the extraction stage. The vision of the Namibian government is to expand the range and value of semi-precious stones and jewelryproducts processed within Namibia, while curbing illicit flows of raw stones. This will simultaneously secure maximum benefit for the country. This study investigated the interventions aimed at making the small scale mining sector in Namibia sustainable. A baseline study was conducted to analyzethe current situation and characterizethe industry, including a SWOT analysis. Information was collected through questionnaires, interviews, consultative meetings, field visits and workshops in order to profile the sector. The baseline study results were used in developing interventions for improving artisanal and small scale mining operations. The main challenges for the Namibian semi-precious sector were identified as: factual information about raw material resources and its beneficiation are insufficient or not available, lack of skills, lack of education and access to finances, rudimentary exploration and mining practices, trading and logistics that are not functioning effectively and inadequate sector governance. One key finding of this study was that Namibia is not benefiting through value addition due partly to illicit flows of the uncut stones and to the fact that lapidary is not much pronounced to a greater extent. The following strategic interventions were identified as key in ensuring the sustainability of the small mining sector in Namibia:conducting geological assessment to identify new deposits and quantify the existing ones, improving exploration and mining practices, investing in education and training, creating an enabling environment and improving the sector governance and strengthening the sector organizationand supporting the infrastructure.},

To help increase understanding of such problems, and to enable consensus-building and effective translation of scientific findings to stakeholders, help inform policies, and ultimately improve decision making, we utilized an Integrated Assessment approach to study artisanal and small-scale gold mining activities in Ghana. Though Integrated Assessments have been used in the fields of environmental science and sustainable development, their use in addressing specific matter in public health, and in particular, environmental and occupational health is quite limited despite their many benefits. The aim of the current paper was to describe specific activities undertaken and how they were organized, and the outputs and outcomes of our activity. In brief, three disciplinary workgroups (Natural Sciences, Human Health, Social Sciences and Economics) were formed, with 26 researchers from a range of Ghanaian institutions plus international experts. The workgroups conducted activities in order to address the following question: What are the causes, consequences and correctives of small-scale gold mining in Ghana? More specifically: What alternatives are available in resource-limited settings in Ghana that allow for gold-mining to occur in a manner that maintains ecological health and human health without hindering near- and long-term economic prosperity? Several response options were identified and evaluated, and are currently being disseminated to various stakeholders within Ghana and internationally.},

The models were compared between each other and with available measurements from 11 monitoring stations of the EMEP measurement network. Because only a very limited number of long-term measurement records of Hg were available, significant attention was given to the intercomparison of modelling results. Monthly and annually averaged values of Hg concentrations and depositions as well as items of the Hg deposition budgets for individual European countries were compared. The models demonstrated good agreement (within +/-20\%) between annual modelled and observed values of gaseous elemental Hg. Modelled values of Hg wet deposition in Western and Central Europe agreed with the observations within +/-45\%. The probability to predict wet depositions within a factor of 2 with regard to measurements was 50-70\% for all the models. The scattering of modelling results for dry depositions of Hg was more significant (up to +/-50\% at the annual scale and even higher for monthly data). Contribution of dry deposition to the total Hg deposition was estimated at 20-30\% with elevated dry deposition fluxes during summer time. The participating models agree in their predictions of transboundary pollution for individual countries within +/-60\% at the monthly scale and within +/-30\% at the annual scale. For the cases investigated, all the models predict that the major part of national anthropogenic Hg emissions is transported outside the country territory.},

This paper helps balance the literature via comparative analysis of the contributions of two voluntary sustainability certification programs for artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) run by Fairtrade International and the Alliance for Responsible Mining. Assessment of four indicators of contribution strength (SDG alignment, rule stringency, uptake patterns, indirect effects) suggest weak to moderate contributions to date. First, only the weakest versions of standards are being adopted and only by miners above the poverty line prior to certification. Second, adoption levels are low, and rates of decertification quite high. Third, indirect effects on consumers and public actors are equally weak. Yet programs do align well with the SDGs. To improve, programs should consider uniting, becoming more “producer friendly,” and decide which role within SDG and ASGM governance regimes they are best suited to play (which may be none at all). Findings contribute to debates on the merits of increasing global governance fragmentation and the role transnationalism in global problem-solving. The understudied ASGM case provides lessons about the diffusion of certification to new sectors, with the aim of guiding global resources towards their most efficient and effective ends.},

At the mean gaseous Hg concentration across the study sites of 1.54\&thinsp;ng\&thinsp;m{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−3}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}, this represents an ability to resolve concentrations to within 0.13\&thinsp;ng\&thinsp;m{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−3}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}.

Going forward, the recalibrated SR adjusted for temperature and wind speed should be used, especially if conditions are highly variable or deviate considerably from the average of the deployments in this study (9.8{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{9}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{∘}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}C, 3.4{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{1}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}\&thinsp;m\&thinsp;s{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−1}}$){\textless}/span{\textgreater}. Overall, the study demonstrates that the sampler is capable of recording background gaseous Hg concentrations across a wide range of environmental conditions with accuracy similar to that of industry standard active sampling instruments. Results at sites with active speciation units were inconclusive on whether the PASs take up total gaseous Hg or solely gaseous elemental Hg primarily because gaseous oxidized Hg concentrations were in a similar range as the uncertainty of the PAS.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {In recent years, the formalization of artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) activities has become a key strategy for governments to better govern and regulate the sector. While scholars have focused on examining the viability of formalization itself, little is known about the outcomes once ASGM operations become formal, or whether formalization efforts are sustainable. Peru has made great strides on simplifying the formalization process and has formalized over 9600 artisanal miners. Drawing on a case study from one of these formalized operations, this research examines postformalization outcomes. Findings from interviews with government officials and members of the ASGM community in one of the most important ASGM regions of Peru, Puno, demonstrate that formalization has yielded mixed results. Formal ASGM operations have improved health and safety practices and labor conditions, and miners believe their environmental awareness has increased. Despite these changes, miners who have become formalized feel even more pursued and scrutinized than they did when they operated informally, and they continue to face challenges obtaining technical support and accessing capital. We argue that although some progress has been made in formalization efforts, the problems and weaknesses within the approach may inadvertently push miners back into informality.We conclude that in order for formalization to be more fruitful for governments and miners, governments working on formalizing ASGM activities would greatly benefit from the creation of a solid postformalization strategy focused on educating and supporting formal ASGM operations.},

	abstract = {Selenium (Se) is an essential dietary element for humans and animals, and the atmosphere is an important source of Se to soils. However, estimates of global atmospheric Se fluxes are highly uncertain. To constrain these uncertainties, we use a global model of atmospheric Se cycling and a database of more than 600 sites where Se in aerosol has been measured. Applying Bayesian inference techniques, we determine the probability distributions of global Se emissions from the four major sources: anthropogenic activities, volcanoes, marine biosphere, and terrestrial biosphere. Between 29 and 36 Gg of Se are emitted to the atmosphere every year, doubling previous estimates of emissions. Using emission parameters optimized by aerosol network measurements, our model shows good agreement with the aerosol Se observations (R2 = 0.66), as well as with independent aerosol (0.59) and wet deposition measurements (0.57). Both model and measurements show a decline in Se over North America in the last two decades because of changes in technology and energy policy. Our results highlight the role of the ocean as a net atmospheric Se sink, with around 7 Gg yr–1 of Se transferred from land through the atmosphere. The constrained Se emissions represent a substantial step forward in understanding the global Se cycle.},

	abstract = {Alluvial gold mining activities in the Peruvian Amazon rainforest are responsible for mercury emissions and deforestation. To understand related environmental impacts, specifically toxicity and climate change, this study uses Life Cycle Assessment methodology. Four predominant extraction systems were selected and modelled and three scenarios that reflect currently available gold recovery systems were modelled: amalgamation, amalgamation with mercury recovery through retort system and gravimetric tables. The USEtox and IPCC life cycle impact assessment methods were used to assess the environmental impacts in term of human toxicity, freshwater ecotoxicity and climate change. Results show that for all systems, human toxicity values are governed by mercury emissions in gold recovery activities (ca. 80\%). However, the use of retort significantly lowers these impacts (ca. 90\%). Machines and diesel use for ore extraction and freighting activities drive freshwater ecotoxicity. Moreover, deforestation has a major contribution on the environmental impacts related to climate change. However, these impacts are dependent on the type of extraction system. Although human toxicity, freshwater ecotoxicity and climate change are frequently studied separately, a direct relationship between them has been identified in this system. Finally, beyond the environmental burdens related to alluvial gold mining, there are impacts affecting the social, cultural, and economic dimensions that will need to be analyzed to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the system.},

Most, however, operate without the requisite permits to mine legally due to a shortage of untitled  land, as well as bureaucratic and costly registration processes.  This article contributes to this discussion, drawing on fresh evidence from Ghana, the location of one of the largest and most  dynamic ASM economies in sub-Saharan Africa.  Here, it is explained, there is a sizable gap between what the government believes ASM is, and what it actually is.  This misdiagnosis has spawned a regulatory apparatus that has proved to be a formidable barrier for ASM operators who are attempting to transition to the formal economy.  But rather than highlighting this oversight, the media, government officials and donors have focused mainly on the negative aspects of the sector that policy has ‘created’, including its environmental footprint, poor health and safety record, and numerous social ‘ills’.  The attention paid to these ‘expressions’ of ASM’s  informality and its unsustainable growth trajectory could potentially derail efforts to formalize a sector which, if adequately supported, could catalyze much-needed economic development in one of the world’s poorest regions.},

	abstract = {Artisanal and small-scale gold mining has been practiced since ancient times in Peru, currently it is developed throughout the national territory, although concentrated in certain regions. Most of this activity is carried out informally and even illegally, characterized by the use of a large amount of labor and low technology; In recent years, situations such as the high price of gold have caused a great growth in this activity. During 2017, as part of the activities of the project of the National Action Plan for Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining, led by the Artisanal Gold Council, UNIDO and with financing from the World Environment Fund, the reference estimates of the use and mercury consumption in ASM. For the development of the estimates, the methodology by Artisanal Gold Council (2015) was used in the Practical Guide for the development of Reference Estimates of the use of Mercury in artisanal and small-scale gold, 2015, accepted by the United Nations. The work focused on the regions of Madre de Dios, Puno, Arequipa and Ayacucho, since they concentrate approximately 94\% of ASM gold production. Among the main results found, it stands out that: The estimated artisanal and small-scale gold production in Peru is 148.77 tons per year, of which 87.97\% is processed by amalgamation with mercury, the remaining 12\% corresponds mainly to cyanidation. The use of mercury for artisanal and smallscale gold processing in Peru causes an annual loss of 362.47 tons of mercury. The region of Madre de Dios, where alluvial mining is practiced, concentrates the largest production of gold in ASM and the largest emissions and releases of mercury (181 tons of mercury), which represents 50\% of the national total, followed by Arequipa and Puno with 21.9 and 17.8\% respectively. Mercury losses occur during the preparation of the amalgam and its burning and are influenced by the type of deposit, the characteristics of the raw ore, the exploitation and benefit methods, and the experience of the operators. In all cases, it has been found that the use of mercury recovery systems such as retorts is very limited and does not have a significant impact on production. The great diversity of mining sites and processing methods means that there is great variability in the ratio of mercury loss to the amount of gold produced, for example the lowest value (2.1:1) was found in the Huepethue area in Madre de Dios with the use of mechanized methods (shute and front loader), while the highest loss ratio was found in Cháparra and Arequipa with the use of quimbaletes (8.7:1). The sector called La Pampa in Madre de Dios is the main source of emissions and releases with 40\% of the national total (145 tons), followed by Rinconada in Puno with 13\% (46 tons) and Secocha in Arequipa with 8\%. (27.8 tons).},

The International Labour Organization (ILO) estimated in 1999 that ASM employed 13 million people iworldwide, making an important contribution to poverty alleviation in rural areas. Despite this positive contribution, the sector often brings a series of environmental and social problems to the areas in which it occurs. The case studies developed for this report ii illustrate that ASGM can transform itself quickly when the correct regulatory, economic, and other conditions are put in place. The sector has a demonstrated ability to seize opportunities, as shown in the case of Peru, and more recently Mongolia, where legal frameworks were promulgated resulting in a “rush” to obtain new mining licenses, iii or in the case of ethical initiatives in which the uptake by the producer organizations of the fair trade certification scheme has been very high. iv This report concludes that high levels of ASGM informality are rooted mainly in legal, political, and economic marginalization vor where legal frameworks and other public policy plans and programs exist but are not designed to address the unique challenges of the sector. It is clear from previous experience, especially UNIDO’s Global Mercury Project, vi that international cooperation and national support for the sector is desirable and welcome. To be effective, the support must be long-term and must deal with the root causes of problems (such as inadequate public policy and a lack of environmental, technical, and entrepreneurial knowledge) while also addressing health, safety, and environmental concerns. In doing so, it will be possible to create the conditions for ASGM to become a profitable and sustainable mining sector.},

After examining the long historical trajectory that has relegated most ASM activities in sub-Saharan Africa to the informal economy, three of the sector’s more obvious economic impacts are reviewed: its contribution to regional mineral outputs; how operations create employment opportunities for millions of people directly, and millions more in the downstream and upstream industries they spawn; and the links the sector has with subsistence agriculture, dynamics which have important implications for food security and gender equality. These contributions alone are sufficient justification for featuring ASM more prominently in the plans, policies and programs being launched in sub-Saharan Africa to help host governments meet their commitments to the SDGs.},

A common method of data transformations is found to unrealistically skew estimates for the examined example application. The method of Lagrange multipliers and two Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods yield more realistic and accurate results. In general, the examined MCMC approaches produce the most realistic result but can require substantial computational time. Lagrange multipliers offer an appealing option for large, computationally intensive problems when exact uncertainty bounds are less central to the analysis.

The Global Mercury Observation System (GMOS) project was funded by the European Commission ({\textless}a href="http://www.gmos.eu" target="\_blank"{\textgreater}http://www.gmos.eu{\textless}/a{\textgreater}) and started in November 2010 with the overall goal to develop a coordinated global observing system to monitor Hg on a global scale, including a large network of ground-based monitoring stations, ad hoc periodic oceanographic cruises and measurement flights in the lower and upper troposphere as well as in the lower stratosphere. To date, more than 40 ground-based monitoring sites constitute the global network covering many regions where little to no observational data were available before GMOS. This work presents atmospheric Hg concentrations recorded worldwide in the framework of the GMOS project (2010–2015), analyzing Hg measurement results in terms of temporal trends, seasonality and comparability within the network. Major findings highlighted in this paper include a clear gradient of Hg concentrations between the Northern and Southern hemispheres, confirming that the gradient observed is mostly driven by local and regional sources, which can be anthropogenic, natural or a combination of both.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The PDFs are constrained by observations of tracer concentrations and account for uncertainty in meteorology, transport, diffusion, and emissions. Meteorological uncertainty is calculated using an ensemble of simulations of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model that samples five categories of model inputs (initialization time, boundary layer physics, land surface model, nudging options, and reanalysis data). The WRF output is used to drive tens of thousands of FLEXPART dispersion simulations that sample a uniform distribution of six emissions inputs. Machine-learning algorithms are trained on the ensemble data and used to quantify the sources of ensemble variability and to infer, via inverse modeling, the values of the 11 model inputs most consistent with tracer measurements. We find a substantial ensemble spread in tracer concentrations (factors of 10 to 10$^{\textrm{3}}$), most of which is due to changing emissions inputs (about 80 \%), though the cumulative effects of meteorological variations are not negligible. The performance of the inverse method is verified using synthetic observations generated from arbitrarily selected simulations. When applied to measurements from a controlled tracer release experiment, the inverse method satisfactorily determines the location, start time, duration and amount. In a 2 km × 2 km area of possible locations, the actual location is determined to within 200 m. The start time is determined to within 5 min out of 2 h, and the duration to within 50 min out of 4 h. Over a range of release amounts of 10 to 1000 kg, the estimated amount exceeds the actual amount of 146 kg by only 32 kg. The inversion also estimates probabilities of different WRF configurations. To best match the tracer observations, the highest-probability cases in WRF are associated with using a late initialization time and specific reanalysis data products.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Mercury is a global pollutant that poses threats to ecosystems and to human health. Due to its global transport, mercury contamination is found in regions of the Earth that are remote from major emissions areas, including the Polar regions. Global anthropogenic emission inventories identify important sectors and industries responsible for emissions at a national level; however, to be useful for air transport modelling, more precise information on the locations of emission is required. This paper describes the methodology applied, and the results of work that was conducted to geospatially distribute anthropogenic mercury emissions as part of the global anthropogenic mercury emissions inventory for 2015 prepared by AMAP/UNEP for the Global Mercury Assessment (GMA) 2018 (UN Environment, 2019). This work includes the identification and use of emission point sources as well as distributing diffuse emissions for 21 emission (industry) sectors. The basic approach involves assigning emission estimates to geo-located point sources, using reported emissions information where available, and otherwise assigning a modelled emission to the point. Emissions which cannot be assigned to point sources are distributed using sector-specific proxies. Mercury speciation highly depends on industry processes and air pollution control technology. Different Hg speciation ratios are therefore applied per sector and country technology level. The resulting global emission datasets include total mercury (HgT), gaseous elemental mercury (Hg0), divalent mercury (Hg2+) and particulate mercury (HgP) in kg per year per raster cell (kg/a). The spatial resolution is flexible and the vertical resolution of the data is based on a set of predefined height classes. The resolution of the GMA2018 emission data is 0.25° × 0.25° with three (physical emission) height classes (0–50, 50–150 and {\textgreater} 150m). A comparison with the EMEP European mercury emission was made based on spatial correlation between the two datasets. Suggested improvements for future work include the further development of proxy data and the implementation of a more structured reporting of emissions by countries.},

	abstract = {From August 22 to September 16, 2012, atmospheric mercury (Hg) was measured from a common manifold in the field during the Reno Atmospheric Mercury Intercomparison eXperiment. Data were collected using Tekran systems, laser induced fluorescence, and evolving new methods. The latter included the University of Washington-Detector for Oxidized Mercury, the University of Houston Mercury instrument, and a filter-based system under development by the University of Nevada-Reno. Good transmission of total Hg was found for the manifold. However, despite application of standard protocols and rigorous quality control, systematic differences in operationally defined forms of Hg were measured by the sampling systems. Concentrations of reactive Hg (RM) measured with new methods were at times 2-to-3-fold higher than that measured by Tekran system. The low RM recovery by the latter can be attributed to lack of collection as the system is currently configured. Concentrations measured by all instruments were influenced by their sampling location in-the-manifold and the instrument analytical configuration. On the basis of collective assessment of the data, we hypothesize that reactions forming RM were occurring in the manifold. Results provide a new framework for improved understanding of the atmospheric chemistry of Hg.},

	abstract = {Mercury (Hg) is a global health concern due to its toxicity and ubiquitous presence in the environment. Here we review current methods for measuring the forms of Hg in the atmosphere and models used to interpret these data. There are three operationally defined forms of atmospheric Hg: gaseous elemental mercury (GEM), gaseous oxidized mercury (GOM), and particulate bound mercury (PBM). There is relative confidence in GEM measurements (collection on a gold surface), but GOM (collection on potassium chloride (KCl)-coated denuder) and PBM (collected using various methods) are less well understood. Field and laboratory investigations suggest the methods to measure GOM and PBM are impacted by analytical interferences that vary with environmental setting (e.g., ozone, relative humidity), and GOM concentrations measured by the KCl-coated denuder can be too low by a factor of 1.6 to 12 depending on the chemical composition of GOM. The composition of GOM (e.g., HgBr2, HgCl2, HgBrOH) varies across space and time. This has important implications for refining existing measurement methods and developing new ones, model/measurement comparisons, model development, and assessing trends. Unclear features of previously published data may now be re-examined and possibly explained, which is demonstrated through a case study. Priorities for future research include identification of GOM compounds in ambient air and development of information on their chemical and physical properties and GOM and PBM calibration systems. With this information, identification of redox mechanisms and associated rate coefficients may be developed.},

Within each topic, the panel drew a series of conclusions, which are presented in this paper. These conclusions led us to concur that the answer to our question is a “qualified yes,” with the qualification being dependent upon the level of uncertainty one is willing to accept. We agreed that the uncertainty is strongly dependent upon scale and that our question as stated is answerable with greater confidence both very near and very far from major point sources, assuming that the “global pool” is a recognizable “source.” Many regions of interest from an ecosystem-exposure standpoint lie in between, where source attribution carries the greatest degree of uncertainty.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric mercury is predominantly present in the gaseous elemental form (Hg0). However, anthropogenic emissions (e.g., incineration, fossil fuel combustion) emit and natural processes create particulate-phase mercury (Hg(p)) and divalent reactive gas-phase mercury (RGM). RGM species (e.g., HgCl2, HgBr2) are water-soluble and have much shorter residence times in the atmosphere than Hg0 due to their higher removal rates through wet and dry deposition mechanisms. Manual and automated annular denuder methodologies, to provide high-resolution (1−2 h) ambient RGM measurements, were developed and evaluated. Following collection of RGM onto KCl-coated quartz annular denuders, RGM was thermally decomposed and quantified as Hg0. Laboratory and field evaluations of the denuders found the RGM collection efficiency to be {\textgreater}94\% and mean collocated precision to be {\textless}15\%. Method detection limits for sampling durations ranging from 1 to 12 h were 6.2−0.5 pg m-3, respectively. As part of this research, the authors observed that methods to measure Hg(p) had a significant positive artifact when RGM coexists with Hg(p). This artifact was eliminated if a KCl-coated annular denuder preceded the filter. This new atmospheric mercury speciation methodology has dramatically enhanced our ability to investigate the mechanisms of transformation and deposition of mercury in the atmosphere.},

The inversion uses the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model (CTM) and its adjoint applied to MOPITT, AIRS, and SCIAMACHY. Observations from TES, surface sites (NOAA/GMD), and aircraft (MOZAIC) are used for evaluation of the a posteriori solution. Using GEOS-Chem as a common intercomparison platform shows global consistency between the different satellite datasets and with the in situ data. Differences can be largely explained by different averaging kernels and a priori information. The global CO emission from combustion as constrained in the inversion is 1350 Tg a$^{\textrm{\&minus;1}}$. This is much higher than current bottom-up emission inventories. A large fraction of the correction results from a seasonal underestimate of CO sources at northern mid-latitudes in winter and suggests a larger-than-expected CO source from vehicle cold starts and residential heating. Implementing this seasonal variation of emissions solves the long-standing problem of models underestimating CO in the northern extratropics in winter-spring. A posteriori emissions also indicate a general underestimation of biomass burning in the GFED2 inventory. However, the tropical biomass burning constraints are not quantitatively consistent across the different datasets.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We use Bayesian inversion methods combining simulations with GEOS-Chem and ground-based Hg$^{\textrm{0}}$ observations from regional monitoring networks and individual sites in recent years. Using optimized emissions/parameters, GEOS-Chem better reproduces these ground-based observations and also matches regional over-water Hg$^{\textrm{0}}$ and wet deposition measurements. The optimized global mercury emission to the atmosphere is {\textasciitilde} 5.8 Gg yr$^{\textrm{−1}}$. The ocean accounts for 3.2 Gg yr$^{\textrm{−1}}$ (55 \% of the total), and the terrestrial ecosystem is neither a net source nor a net sink of Hg$^{\textrm{0}}$. The optimized Asian anthropogenic emission of Hg$^{\textrm{0}}$ (gas elemental mercury) is 650–1770 Mg yr$^{\textrm{−1}}$, higher than its bottom-up estimates (550–800 Mg yr$^{\textrm{−1}}$). The ocean parameter inversions suggest that dark oxidation of aqueous elemental mercury is faster, and less mercury is removed from the mixed layer through particle sinking, when compared with current simulations. Parameter changes affect the simulated global ocean mercury budget, particularly mass exchange between the mixed layer and subsurface waters. Based on our inversion results, we re-evaluate the long-term global biogeochemical cycle of mercury, and show that legacy mercury becomes more likely to reside in the terrestrial ecosystem than in the ocean. We estimate that primary anthropogenic mercury contributes up to 23 \% of present-day atmospheric deposition.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

We synthesize understanding of sources, atmosphere-land-ocean Hg dynamics and health effects, and consider the implications of Hg-control policies. Primary anthropogenic Hg emissions greatly exceed natural geogenic sources, resulting in increases in Hg reservoirs and subsequent secondary Hg emissions that facilitate its global distribution. The ultimate fate of emitted Hg is primarily recalcitrant soil pools and deep ocean waters and sediments. Transfers of Hg emissions to largely unavailable reservoirs occur over the time scale of centuries, and are primarily mediated through atmospheric exchanges of wet/dry deposition and evasion from vegetation, soil organic matter and ocean surfaces. A key link between inorganic Hg inputs and exposure of humans and wildlife is the net production of methylmercury, which occurs mainly in reducing zones in freshwater, terrestrial, and coastal environments, and the subsurface ocean. Elevated human exposure to methylmercury primarily results from consumption of estuarine and marine fish. Developing fetuses are most at risk from this neurotoxin but health effects of highly exposed populations and wildlife are also a concern. Integration of Hg science with national and international policy efforts is needed to target efforts and evaluate efficacy.},

	abstract = {Mercury pollution poses global human health and environmental risks. Although mercury is naturally present in the environment, human activities, such as coal burning, have increased the amount of mercury cycling among the land, atmosphere, and ocean by a factor of three to five. Emitted to the atmosphere in its elemental form, mercury travels worldwide before oxidizing to a form that deposits to ecosystems. In aquatic systems, mercury can convert into methylmercury, a potent neurotoxin. People and wildlife are exposed to methylmercury as it bioaccumulates up the food chain. Mercury continues to circulate in the atmosphere, oceans, and terrestrial system for centuries to millennia before it returns to deep-ocean sediments. Areas of uncertainty in the global biogeochemical cycle of mercury include oxidation processes in the atmosphere, land-atmosphere and ocean-atmosphere cycling, and methylation processes in the ocean. National and international policies have addressed direct mercury emissions, but further efforts to reduce risks face numerous political and technical challenges.},

We can reproduce these observations with the GEOS-Chem global tropospheric chemistry model by including a broader consideration of multiphase halogen (Br-Cl) chemistry than has been done in the past. Important reactions for regenerating BrO from its nonradical reservoirs include HOBr + Br−/Cl− in both aerosols and clouds, and oxidation of Br− by ClNO3 and ozone. Most tropospheric BrO in the model is in the free troposphere, consistent with observations and originates mainly from the photolysis and oxidation of ocean-emitted CHBr3. Stratospheric input is also important in the upper troposphere. Including production of gas phase inorganic bromine from debromination of acidified sea salt aerosol increases free tropospheric Bry by about 30\%. We find HOBr to be the dominant gas-phase reservoir of inorganic bromine. Halogen (Br-Cl) radical chemistry as implemented here in GEOS-Chem drives 14\% and 11\% decreases in the global burdens of tropospheric ozone and OH, respectively, a 16\% increase in the atmospheric lifetime of methane, and an atmospheric lifetime of 6 months for elemental mercury. The dominant mechanism for the Br-Cl driven tropospheric ozone decrease is oxidation of NOx by formation and hydrolysis of BrNO3 and ClNO3.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Mercury (Hg) is emitted to the atmosphere mainly as volatile elemental Hg$^{\textrm{0}}$. Oxidation to water-soluble Hg$^{\textrm{II}}$ plays a major role in Hg deposition to ecosystems. Here, we implement a new mechanism for atmospheric Hg$^{\textrm{0}}$ ∕ Hg$^{\textrm{II}}$ redox chemistry in the GEOS-Chem global model and examine the implications for the global atmospheric Hg budget and deposition patterns. Our simulation includes a new coupling of GEOS-Chem to an ocean general circulation model (MITgcm), enabling a global 3-D representation of atmosphere–ocean Hg$^{\textrm{0}}$ ∕ Hg$^{\textrm{II}}$ cycling. We find that atomic bromine (Br) of marine organobromine origin is the main atmospheric Hg$^{\textrm{0}}$ oxidant and that second-stage HgBr oxidation is mainly by the NO$_{\textrm{2}}$ and HO$_{\textrm{2}}$ radicals. The resulting chemical lifetime of tropospheric Hg$^{\textrm{0}}$ against oxidation is 2.7 months, shorter than in previous models. Fast Hg$^{\textrm{II}}$ atmospheric reduction must occur in order to match the ∼ 6-month lifetime of Hg against deposition implied by the observed atmospheric variability of total gaseous mercury (TGM ≡ Hg$^{\textrm{0}}$ + Hg$^{\textrm{II}}$(g)). We implement this reduction in GEOS-Chem as photolysis of aqueous-phase Hg$^{\textrm{II}}$–organic complexes in aerosols and clouds, resulting in a TGM lifetime of 5.2 months against deposition and matching both mean observed TGM and its variability. Model sensitivity analysis shows that the interhemispheric gradient of TGM, previously used to infer a longer Hg lifetime against deposition, is misleading because Southern Hemisphere Hg mainly originates from oceanic emissions rather than transport from the Northern Hemisphere. The model reproduces the observed seasonal TGM variation at northern midlatitudes (maximum in February, minimum in September) driven by chemistry and oceanic evasion, but it does not reproduce the lack of seasonality observed at southern hemispheric marine sites. Aircraft observations in the lowermost stratosphere show a strong TGM–ozone relationship indicative of fast Hg$^{\textrm{0}}$ oxidation, but we show that this relationship provides only a weak test of Hg chemistry because it is also influenced by mixing. The model reproduces observed Hg wet deposition fluxes over North America, Europe, and China with little bias (0–30 \%). It reproduces qualitatively the observed maximum in US deposition around the Gulf of Mexico, reflecting a combination of deep convection and availability of NO$_{\textrm{2}}$ and HO$_{\textrm{2}}$ radicals for second-stage HgBr oxidation. However, the magnitude of this maximum is underestimated. The relatively low observed Hg wet deposition over rural China is attributed to fast Hg$^{\textrm{II}}$ reduction in the presence of high organic aerosol concentrations. We find that 80 \% of Hg$^{\textrm{II}}$ deposition is to the global oceans, reflecting the marine origin of Br and low concentrations of organic aerosols for Hg$^{\textrm{II}}$ reduction. Most of that deposition takes place to the tropical oceans due to the availability of HO$_{\textrm{2}}$ and NO$_{\textrm{2}}$ for second-stage HgBr oxidation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Mercury data consisted of gaseous elemental Hg (GEM) and "reactive Hg" (RM), which is a combination of the gaseous oxidized (GOM) and particulate bound ({\textless} 2.5 μm) (PBM) fractions as measured by the Tekran$^{\textrm{®}}$ system. We used a subset of the observations by defining a "free tropospheric" (FT) data set by screening using measured water vapor mixing ratios. The oxidation scheme used by the GEOS-Chem model was varied between the standard run with Br oxidation and an alternative run with OH–O$_{\textrm{3}}$ oxidation. We used this model–measurement comparison to help interpret the spatio-temporal trends in, and relationships among, the Hg species and ancillary parameters, to understand better the sources and fate of atmospheric RM. The most salient feature of the data across sites, seen more in summer relative to spring, was that RM was negatively correlated with GEM and water vapor mixing ratios (WV) and positively correlated with ozone (O$_{\textrm{3}}$), both in the standard model and the observations, indicating that RM was formed in dry upper altitude air from the photo-oxidation of GEM. During a free tropospheric transport high RM event observed sequentially at three sites from Oregon to Nevada, the slope of the RM / GEM relationship at the westernmost site was −1020 ± 209 pg ng$^{\textrm{−1}}$, indicating near-quantitative GEM-to-RM photochemical conversion. An improved correlation between the observations and the model was seen when the model was run with the OH–O$_{\textrm{3}}$ oxidation scheme instead of the Br oxidation scheme. This simulation produced higher concentrations of RM and lower concentrations of GEM, especially at the desert sites in northwestern Nevada. This suggests that future work should investigate the effect of Br- and O$_{\textrm{3}}$-initiated gas-phase oxidation occurring simultaneously in the atmosphere, as well as aqueous and heterogeneous reactions to understand whether there are multiple global oxidants for GEM and hence multiple forms of RM in the atmosphere. If the chemical forms of RM were known, then the collection efficiency of the analytical method could be evaluated better.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The Montreal Protocol was designed to protect the stratospheric ozone layer by enabling reductions in the abundance of ozone-depleting substances such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in the atmosphere1–3. The reduction in the atmospheric concentration of trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11) has made the second-largest contribution to the decline in the total atmospheric concentration of ozone-depleting chlorine since the 1990s1. However, CFC-11 still contributes one-quarter of all chlorine reaching the stratosphere, and a timely recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer depends on a sustained decline in CFC-11 concentrations1. Here we show that the rate of decline of atmospheric CFC-11 concentrations observed at remote measurement sites was constant from 2002 to 2012, and then slowed by about 50 per cent after 2012. The observed slowdown in the decline of CFC-11 concentration was concurrent with a 50 per cent increase in the mean concentration difference observed between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, and also with the emergence of strong correlations at the Mauna Loa Observatory between concentrations of CFC-11 and other chemicals associated with anthropogenic emissions. A simple model analysis of our findings suggests an increase in CFC-11 emissions of 13 ± 5 gigagrams per year (25 ± 13 per cent) since 2012, despite reported production being close to zero4 since 2006. Our three-dimensional model simulations confirm the increase in CFC-11 emissions, but indicate that this increase may have been as much as 50 per cent smaller as a result of changes in stratospheric processes or dynamics. The increase in emission of CFC-11 appears unrelated to past production; this suggests unreported new production, which is inconsistent with the Montreal Protocol agreement to phase out global CFC production by 2010.},

	abstract = {The recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer relies on the continued decline in the atmospheric concentrations of ozone-depleting gases such as chlorofluorocarbons1. The atmospheric concentration of trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11), the second-most abundant chlorofluorocarbon, has declined substantially since the mid-1990s2. A recently reported slowdown in the decline of the atmospheric concentration of CFC-11 after 2012, however, suggests that global emissions have increased3,4. A concurrent increase in CFC-11 emissions from eastern Asia contributes to the global emission increase, but the location and magnitude of this regional source are unknown3. Here, using high-frequency atmospheric observations from Gosan, South Korea, and Hateruma, Japan, together with global monitoring data and atmospheric chemical transport model simulations, we investigate regional CFC-11 emissions from eastern Asia. We show that emissions from eastern mainland China are 7.0 ± 3.0 (±1 standard deviation) gigagrams per year higher in 2014–2017 than in 2008–2012, and that the increase in emissions arises primarily around the northeastern provinces of Shandong and Hebei. This increase accounts for a substantial fraction (at least 40 to 60 per cent) of the global rise in CFC-11 emissions. We find no evidence for a significant increase in CFC-11 emissions from any other eastern Asian countries or other regions of the world where there are available data for the detection of regional emissions. The attribution of any remaining fraction of the global CFC-11 emission rise to other regions is limited by the sparsity of long-term measurements of sufficient frequency near potentially emissive regions. Several considerations suggest that the increase in CFC-11 emissions from eastern mainland China is likely to be the result of new production and use, which is inconsistent with the Montreal Protocol agreement to phase out global chlorofluorocarbon production by 2010.},

	abstract = {The presence of toxic substances such as persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the environment, and in organisms including humans, is a serious public health and environmental problem, even at low levels and poses a challenging scientific problem. The Stockholm Convention on POPs (SC) entered into force in 2004 and is a large international effort under the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to facilitate cooperation in monitoring, modeling and the design of effective and fair ways to deal with POPs globally. This paper is a contribution to the ongoing effectiveness evaluation (EE) work aimed at the assessment and enhancement of the effectiveness of the actions undertaken under the SC. First we consider some aspects related to the monitoring of POPs in the environment and then briefly review modeling frameworks that have been used to simulate long range transport (LRT) of POPs. In the final sections we describe the institutional arrangements providing the conditions for this work to unfold now and some suggestions for it in the future. A more effective use of existing monitoring data could be made if scientists who deposited them in publicly available and supervised sites were rewarded in academic and professional terms. We also suggest the development of multi-media, nested, Lagrangian models to improve the understanding of changes over time in the environment and individual organisms.},

The objective of this Convention is to protect human health and the environment by controlling the releases of POPs. According to its Article 16, the effectiveness of the Stockholm Convention shall be evaluated using comparable monitoring data on the presence of POPs as well as their regional and global environmental transport. Here, we present a time series analysis on atmospheric POP concentrations from 15 monitoring stations in North America and Europe that provide long-term data and have started operations between 1990 and 2003. We systematically searched for temporal trends and significant structural changes in temporal trends that might result from the provisions of the Stockholm Convention. We find that such structural changes do occur, but they are related mostly to effects of national regulations enforced prior to the implementation of the Stockholm Convention, rather than to the enforcement of the provisions laid out in the Convention. One example is that concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls, many of which started to decrease rapidly during the 1990s. Also effects of chemical transport and fate, for instance the re-volatilization of POPs from secondary sources, are thought to be a cause of some of the observed structural changes. We conclude that a decade of air monitoring data has not been sufficient for detecting general and statistically significant effects of the Stockholm Convention. Based on these lessons, we present recommendations for the future operation of existing monitoring programs and advocate for a stricter enforcement of the provisions of the Stockholm Convention, in the current absence of proof for its effectiveness.},

In this area, ASGM has increased significantly since 2000 and has led to substantial political and social controversy. This research examined the spatial distribution and transport of mercury through the Madre de Dios River with distance from ASGM activity. This study also characterized risks for dietary mercury exposure to local residents who depend on fish from the river. River sediment, suspended solids from the water column, and fish samples were collected in 2013 at 62 sites near 17 communities over a 560 km stretch of the Madre de Dios River and its major tributaries. In areas downstream of known ASGM activity, mercury concentrations in sediment, suspended solids, and fish within the Madre de Dios River were elevated relative to locations upstream of mining. Fish tissue mercury concentrations were observed at levels representing a public health threat, with greater than one-third of carnivorous fish exceeding the international health standard of 0.5 mg kg−1. This study demonstrates that communities located hundreds of kilometers downstream of ASGM activity, including children and indigenous populations who may not be involved in mining, are at risk of dietary mercury exposure that exceed acceptable body burdens. This report represents the first systematic study of the region to aid policy decision-making related to ASGM activities in Peru.},

	abstract = {Many factors such as poverty, ineffective institutions and environmental regulations may prevent developing countries from managing how natural resources are extracted to meet a strong market demand. Extraction for some resources has reached such proportions that evidence is measurable from space. We present recent evidence of the global demand for a single commodity and the ecosystem destruction resulting from commodity extraction, recorded by satellites for one of the most biodiverse areas of the world. We find that since 2003, recent mining deforestation in Madre de Dios, Peru is increasing nonlinearly alongside a constant annual rate of increase in international gold price (∼18\%/yr). We detect that the new pattern of mining deforestation (1915 ha/year, 2006–2009) is outpacing that of nearby settlement deforestation. We show that gold price is linked with exponential increases in Peruvian national mercury imports over time (R2 = 0.93, p = 0.04, 2003–2009). Given the past rates of increase we predict that mercury imports may more than double for 2011 (∼500 t/year). Virtually all of Peru's mercury imports are used in artisanal gold mining. Much of the mining increase is unregulated/artisanal in nature, lacking environmental impact analysis or miner education. As a result, large quantities of mercury are being released into the atmosphere, sediments and waterways. Other developing countries endowed with gold deposits are likely experiencing similar environmental destruction in response to recent record high gold prices. The increasing availability of satellite imagery ought to evoke further studies linking economic variables with land use and cover changes on the ground.},

	abstract = {Mercury (Hg) is used by small-scale gold miners in more than 50 developing countries, where the accompanied releases affect human health and the environment. The objectives of this paper are to summarize present use of Hg in artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) worldwide, reveal the origin of part of the Hg used by the gold miners, and propose appropriate actions to reduce the resulting Hg emissions. Significant releases of mercury are associated with inefficient amalgamation techniques. Releases are estimated to range from 800 to 1000tonne/annum. Of this total, approximately 200–250tonne of Hg are released in China, 100–150tonne in Indonesia, and 10–30tonne each in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Philippines, Venezuela and Zimbabwe. Mercury usually enters these countries legally – typically imported from countries in the European Union – although in some cases and in some years (e.g., Indonesia, Venezuela, etc.), the reported imports of Hg are far below estimated consumption. Meanwhile, the EU, while gradually replacing Hg products and processes with more environmentally benign alternatives, paradoxically continues to produce virgin Hg at government-owned mines, further exacerbating a general global oversupply of Hg – evident from its historically low market price. Political leadership is needed to avoid the transfer of excess Hg, and related health and environmental risks from the EU to third countries. Otherwise, the present situation will continue or even worsen, with no oversight or control of the global Hg trade in which the transfer of excess EU Hg to artisanal miners is favoured by low Hg prices relative to gold prices.},

	abstract = {Artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) is a significant contributor of mercury (Hg) contamination and deforestation across the globe. In the Colorado River watershed in Madre de Dios, Peru, mining and deforestation have increased exponentially since the 1980s, resulting in major socioeconomic shifts in the region and two national state of emergency (2016 and 2019) in response to concerns for wide-scale mercury poisoning by these activities. This research employed a watershed-scale soil particle detachment model and environmental field sampling to estimate the role of land cover change and soil erosion on river transport of Hg in a heavily ASGM-impacted watershed. The model estimated that observed decreases in forest cover increased soil mobilization by a factor of two in the Colorado River watershed during the 18 year period and by 4-fold in the Puquiri subwatershed (the area of most concentrated ASGM activity). If deforestation continues to increase at its current exponential rate through 2030, the annual mobilization of soil and Hg may increase by an additional 20–25\% relative to 2014 levels. While, the estimated total mass of Hg transported by rivers is substantially less than the estimated tons of Hg used with ASGM in Peru, this research shows that deforestation associated with ASGM is an additional mechanism for mobilizing naturally occurring and anthropogenic Hg from terrestrial landscapes to aquatic environments in the region, potentially leading to bioaccumulation in fish and exposure to communities downstream.},

	abstract = {We estimate mercury releases from artisanal and small scale gold mining (ASGM) based on available data about mercury and gold exports and imports by country and from field reports from the countries known to have active ASGM communities. The quality of the estimates ranges from reasonable to poor across the countries. This paper aims to give a first order estimate of the amount and location of mercury being released into the environment globally by ASGM, to motivate stakeholders to improve the quality of these estimates, to illustrate the linkages between global mercury trade and its use in ASGM, and the fourth objective is to provide a practical outline of the options available for reducing mercury use in ASGM. We estimate that artisanal and small scale gold mining releases between 640 to 1350 Mg of mercury per annum into the environment, averaging 1000 Mg yr-1, from at least 70 countries. 350 Mg yr-1 of this are directly emitted to the atmosphere while the remainder (650 Mg yr-1) are released into the hydrosphere (rivers, lakes, soils, tailings). However, a significant but unknown portion of the amount released into the hydrosphere is later emitted to the atmosphere when it volatilizes (latent emissions). Considering that ASGM is growing, latent emissions conservatively amount to at least 50 Mg yr-1 bringing the total emission of mercury to the atmosphere from ASGM to 400 Mg yr-1. This estimate of emission to the atmosphere differs from the previous one provided in the 2002 UNEP Global Mercury Assessment both in terms of its magnitude (400 Mg yr-1, versus 300 Mg yr-1) and in the way the estimate has been made. The current estimate is based on a better understanding of ASGM and on a wider variety of information sources, more field evidence, better extrapolation methods, and independent testing by analysis of official trade data.},

	abstract = {Mercury is a global pollutant released into the biosphere by varied human activities including coal combustion, mining, artisanal gold mining, cement production, and chemical production. Once released to air, land and water, the addition of carbon atoms to mercury by bacteria results in the production of methylmercury, the toxic form that bioaccumulates in aquatic and terrestrial food chains resulting in elevated exposure to humans and wildlife. Global recognition of the mercury contamination problem has resulted in the Minamata Convention on Mercury, which came into force in 2017. The treaty aims to protect human health and the environment from human-generated releases of mercury curtailing its movement and transformations in the biosphere. Coincident with the treaty’s coming into force, the 13th International Conference of Mercury as a Global Pollutant (ICMGP-13) was held in Providence, Rhode Island USA. At ICMGP-13, cutting edge research was summarized and presented to address questions relating to global and regional sources and cycling of mercury, how that mercury is methylated, the effects of mercury exposure on humans and wildlife, and the science needed for successful implementation of the Minamata Convention. Human activities have the potential to enhance mercury methylation by remobilizing previously released mercury, and increasing methylation efficiency. This synthesis concluded that many of the most important factors influencing the fate and effects of mercury and its more toxic form, methylmercury, stem from environmental changes that are much broader in scope than mercury releases alone. Alterations of mercury cycling, methylmercury bioavailability and trophic transfer due to climate and land use changes remain critical uncertainties in effective implementation of the Minamata Convention. In the face of these uncertainties, important policy and management actions are needed over the short-term to support the control of mercury releases to land, water and air. These include adequate monitoring and communication on risk from exposure to various forms of inorganic mercury as well as methylmercury from fish and rice consumption. Successful management of global and local mercury pollution will require integration of mercury research and policy in a changing world.},

The TiO2NPs functionalization occurred for the photocatalytic properties of titania-anatase when UV-irradiated in an aqueous solution containing HAuCl4. The resulting nanostructured suspension was deposited by drop-casting on a thin quartz slices, dried and then incorporated into a common axial sampler to be investigated as a potential PAS device. The morphological characteristics of the sample were studied by High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy, Atomic Force Microscopy, and Optical Microscopy. UV-Vis spectra showed a blue shift of the membrane when exposed to Hg0 vapors. The adsorbed mercury was thermally desorbed for a few minutes, and then quantified by a mercury vapor analyzer. Such a sampling system reported an efficiency of adsorption that was equal to ≈95\%. Temperature and relative humidity only mildly affected the membrane performances. These structures seem to be promising candidates for mercury samplers, due to both the strong affinity of gold with Hg, and the wide adsorbing surface.},

	abstract = {A set of statistical indicators fit for air quality model evaluation is selected based on experience and literature: The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), the bias, the Standard Deviation (SD) and the correlation coefficient (R). Among these the RMSE is proposed as the key one for the description of the model skill. Model Performance Criteria (MPC) to investigate whether model results are ‘good enough’ for a given application are calculated based on the observation uncertainty (U). The basic concept is to allow for model results a similar margin of tolerance (in terms of uncertainty) as for observations. U is pollutant, concentration level and station dependent, therefore the proposed MPC are normalized by U. Some composite diagrams are adapted or introduced to visualize model performance in terms of the proposed MPC and are illustrated in a real modeling application. The Target diagram, used to visualize the RMSE, is adapted with a new normalization on its axis, while complementary diagrams are proposed. In this first application the dependence of U on concentrations level is ignored, and an assumption on the pollutant dependent relative error is made. The advantages of this new approach are finally described.},
