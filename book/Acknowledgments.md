Acknowledgments
============

I am filled with sincere gratitude as I think about my time at MIT, the journey to get here and all the people that have helped me along the way. Most importantly, I would like to thank Noelle Selin, my research advisor, for welcoming me into her research group. 

This thesis would not have been possible without the Selin Group's training, challenging questions, and comradery. I am especially grateful to Aryeh Feinberg for his unyielding patience, for helping me with GEOS-Chem, and for encouragement. Thank you to all of the Selin Group's members. I have learned much from you.

I would like to thank Barb DeLaBarre, Elena Byrne, Ed Ballo, and Frank Field for everything they do for us. I am grateful to the TPPers in the classes ahead of us who provided invaluable advice on how to navigate MIT since we began our time remotely. Thanks to my TPP cohort (class of 22), we were able to learn, grow, and explore MIT in a supportive environment that we all created and sustained. 

I am also grateful to everyone who has contributed to my academic journey. From my primary school teachers in Manzini, Eswatini to all the professors I have had here at MIT, I am grateful. Thank you to my mentors who have provided guidance and support. 

To Moreen: Thank you for your love that has kept me sane and helped me grow. You have been my strength through this journey's ups and downs. I love you. 

And finally, thank you to my family in Eswatini. I would not be where I am today without your love and support. I love you.

 This research was supported by a grant (#1924148) from the US National Science Foundation.
